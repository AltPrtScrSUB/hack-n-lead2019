Mexico says U.S. fentanyl crackdown led to botched arrest of El Chapo's son	"By Daina Beth SolomonMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico security minister said on Friday that U.S. efforts to curb the opioid fentanyl were behind the brief arrest of a son of imprisoned kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman last month in Sinaloa, home turf for the notorious Sinaloa Cartel.After the United States requested his extradition, Ovidio Guzman was briefly arrested, then freed by outnumbered officials who feared a bloody confrontation with cartel henchmen. Mexican Security Minister Alfonso Durazo said Guzman was wanted on allegations of smuggling fentanyl, the potent opioid responsible for an overdose epidemic in the United States.  Guzman role has grown since his father Joaquin Guzman was extradited in 2017 to face drug charges. Joaquin Guzman is now serving a life sentence in a U.S. prison.""One of the very reasons for the U.S. interest, and the basis for the extradition order, is in fact the suspected link between this alleged criminal and introducing fentanyl into the United States,"" Durazo told reporters.A U.S. district court indictment against Ovidio Guzman, issued in February, charged him with conspiring to traffic cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana, but did not mention fentanyl.U.S. President Donald Trump in August said Mexico needed to do more to halt fentanyl production and smuggling across the U.S.-Mexico border.The Sinaloa Cartel is likely one of Mexico top fentanyl traffickers to the United States, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).More recently, the cartel appears to have moved into production of the drug.In September, DEA officers took part in a ""covert mission"" in Sinaloa, the agency said in a statement at the time.""Profit margins for fentanyl and methamphetamine are driving the drug trade by the cartels,"" the statement said. In April, officials raided a fentanyl laboratory in Sinaloa capital of Culiacan, where the younger Guzman and his brothers control the drug trade. Law enforcement also busted a fentanyl laboratory in Mexico City last year.The National Institute of Drug Abuse reported earlier this year that 130 people die every day in the United States after overdosing on opioids, which include prescription pain relievers, heroin and synthetic drugs like fentanyl.<p/> (Reporting by Daina Beth Solomon; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel)"

Thai court increases prison time for officials in Rohingya trafficking case	BANGKOK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - A Thai court of appeal hasincreased prison time for a former army general and more thanfifty others convicted in the country largest humantrafficking trial.The case, which involved 103 defendants, began in 2015 aftera crackdown following the gruesome discovery of dozens ofshallow graves in jungle camps near the Thai-Malaysian border.Traffickers had been using the camps to hold mostly RohingyaMuslim migrants hostage until their relatives were able to payfor their release, authorities said.In 2017, a criminal court sentenced 62 defendants on 13different charges, including trafficking in persons, smugglingillegal migrants into the country and organised crime.The appeals court late on Thursday dismissed convictions fortwo defendants while increasing the jail terms for 55 otherswith additional charges of smuggling illegal migrants.

UPDATE 1-Migrants in Greece living in 'horrible' conditions, says Europe rights watchdog	"(Updates with parliament approving new asylum rules, PM quote)By Lefteris PapadimasATHENS, Oct 31 (Reuters) - A European human rights watchdogon Thursday slammed living conditions as ""horrible"" forthousands of asylum seekers in overcrowded Greek camps,including waits spanning several hours for food and toilets anda lack of access to medicine.Dunja Mijatovic, Council of Europe Commissioner for HumanRights, said she had witnessed people queuing for food or to usea bathroom for more than three hours at refugee camps for asylumseekers on two Greek islands.""The people I have met are living in horrible conditions andan unbearable limbo,"" she told a news briefing, saying themigrants were struggling to cope with overcrowding, lack ofshelter, poor hygiene conditions and substandard access tomedical care.Greece is currently struggling with the biggest resurgencein refugee arrivals since 2015, when more than a million peoplecrossed into Europe from Turkey via Greece. About 34,000 asylumseekers and refugees are currently being held in camps on theAegean islands close to Turkey.Although the conservative government has started moving morepeople to the mainland, the surge in migrant arrivals means theyare being replaced as quickly as they depart.""I saw children with skin diseases not treated. I heardabout no medications or drugs at all available to these people.No access to health, no proper access to health and many otherthings that are really quite shocking for Europe in the 21stcentury,"" Mijatovic said.The government has broadly blamed the overcrowding on ahaphazard approach by the former leftist administration, whichlost the election held in July. It plans to move as many as20,000 asylum seekers to the mainland by the end of the year.Late on Thursday, the Greek parliament approved legislationamending the asylum process, a bill which rights groups saycould restrict protection for asylum seekers.The government says the new legislation seeks to codify andclarify what are now a disparate set of rules into one rulebook,and to deport those whose applications have been rejected.Several NGOs, and the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR,have expressed misgivings about the legislation, saying itweakens the protection of refugees.Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told parliament beforethe vote that the bill was also meant to send a clear message:""Enough is enough, enough with those people who know thatthey are not entitled to asylum and yet they attempt to crossinto and stay in our country,"" he said.""Those people will be quickly returned to Turkey... or totheir country and will lose all the money they gave thedespicable traffickers"".(Reporting By Lefteris Papadimas, writing by Michele Kambas;Editing by Bernadette Baum and Richard Pullin)"

But now he regularly unlockshis old cell door to show tourists what life was like in a jailrun by the Stasi secret police.A West German responsible for his chemical companybusiness in the East, Schulze was on his way to a trade fair inthe East German city of Leipzig in 1986 when he stopped at amotorway service station and met a woman by chance.Schulze, now 66, was fascinated by the well-dressed womanand they began a relationship. The East-West dimension of theirliaison gave Schulze a thrill, but to this day he does not knowfor sure whether she loved him or was just using him.""I didn't know that she was an unofficial Stasi informant,""said Schulze, who gives tours of Hohenschoenhausen prison, wherehe spent some of his 13 months behind bars three decades ago, ineastern Berlin.""It was only later, when the accusation of spying wasraised, that everything appeared in a different light.""Such themes of temptation, duplicity and betrayal thatmarked Cold War-era espionage have come back into focus in therun-up to the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall onNov. 9 that brought about German reunification.<p/>""ROMEO SPIES""Schulze found out some time after he became romanticallyinvolved with the woman that her husband - from whom she wasseparated - worked for the Stasi, but he did not grasp the fullextent until the media reported on her Stasi files in 2009.Under its foreign intelligence chief Markus Wolf, the Stasiperfected the use of ""Romeo spies"" - agents who used theirpersonal charms as well as their wiles to ensnare Westernsources of valuable intelligence.Unbeknown to Schulze, his lover had been tasked by the Stasiwith picking up solo travellers and business people from theWest. She told him she wanted to flee to the West and Schulzestill isn't sure whether that was her personal desire or whetherthe Stasi wanted her to continue working for them in the West.Three years before the fall of the Wall, Schulze wasarrested at the border as he tried to leave the East. A letterthe woman had written about her husband work was found in hiscar, as was some money she wanted Schulze to take to the West.Schulze was accused of spying and a day later his lover wasarrested, though he is not sure what the charge against her was.East German authorities ultimately withdrew accusations ofspying, subversive human trafficking and betraying state secrets- which would have triggered a long prison term - and he wasultimately sentenced to 2-1/2 years in prison for currencycrimes and helping prepare an illegal border crossing.""I can tell you it really hits you hard. You have to absorbit first,"" he said of the emotional manipulation. ""And I knownow that they did it on purpose - that what I accuse them of.""Schulze thinks his status as a West German meant he wasprobably treated better than others at Hohenschoenhausen, wherephysical violence was widely used in the 1950s beforepsychological interrogation methods took over.He was transferred to another prison before his release inOctober 1987. His lover, who had spent her imprisonment workingin the kitchen at Hohenschoenhausen, was freed a month later.They saw each other in prison but Schulze said theirrelationship ended around the time they were released, and afterreunification in 1990 she became a car saleswoman and hoteldirector in the West.It was initially hard for Schulze to return to the prisonfollowingr reunification but he wants to make sure that others -including children born long after East Germany collapsed - knowwhat happened behind the prison walls.He now tells his story to some of the more than 455,000people who visit Hohenschoenhausen every year. Thousands ofpolitical prisoners were incarcerated in the prison, which hassince been turned into a museum and memorial.""That period of time still affects me to this day and thatwhy I give tours here now, to pass on the message,"" Schulzesaid.(Additional reporting by Inke Kappeler and Thomas EscrittWriting by Michelle MartinEditing by Paul Carrel and Mark Heinrich)"

In Vietnamâs âBillionaire Villageâ, migrant cash can buy a palace	"DO THANH, Vietnam, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Vietnam ""BillionaireVillage"" doesn't sound like a place people would want to leave,but at least three of the 39 victims found in the back of alorry in Britain last week set off from there in search of theirfortunes.A billion dong may only be around $43,000, but in the rural,northern-central Vietnamese town of Do Thanh, the money goes along way, and even farmers live in palatial mansions, paid forwith money sent back by family members working abroad.""70-80% of the villas here have been built withremittances,"" said Nguyen Van Ha, chairman of the rural,rice-farming commune in Nghe An province.""If you work in Vietnam earning dong, it would take a longtime to build a big house like this,"" Ha said, gesturing to thelarge, multi-storey villas flanking the town hall.In Do Thanh, even the majestic, renaissance-style churchtowering over the plush, neighbouring villas was built withremittance money donated by the Catholic community.Many other victims are believed to come from outside thetown, in the surrounding district of Yen Thanh. In the 1980s, DoThanh used to be one of the district poorest villages,according to state media.One resident, 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung, is thought by herfamily to be among the dead. She left a trail of messages on hersocial media account documenting her journey through Europe inthe days before she boarded the fated vehicle.Deputy Foreign Minister Nguyen Quoc Cuong told Reuters onTuesday the nationality of the victims had not been officiallyconfirmed but that Vietnam and Britain were ""trying to speed upidentification of the bodies"".The grisly discovery last week on an industrial estate nearLondon, a magnet for Vietnamese migrants, has shone a spotlighton people smugglers bringing the poor of Asia, Africa and theMiddle East on perilous journeys to the West.In Vietnam, poor job prospects, encouragement byauthorities, smuggling gangs, environmental disasters andgovernment pressure on Catholics are all factors pushing peopleto leave.<p/>REMITTANCE RISEBut even though the cost of getting to Europe can run intothousands of dollars for migrants ready to pay for a so-called""VIP"" service, they believe they can make enough money tojustify the risk.""We know that many residents of this district are living inBritain, but we have no idea what they do there to earn all thismoney to send back home,"" Ha said.Overseas workers sent nearly $16 billion in remittances toVietnam in 2018, more than double the Southeast Asian countrytrade surplus for the same period, according to World Bank datathat showed remittances had risen 130% over the last decade.In Nghe An and neighbouring Ha Tinh province, officialpolicy supports the legal export of labour.Nghe An province alone rakes in some $255 million annuallyfrom its overseas citizens, according to state media.""The remittance figures might be higher than reported asmoney transferred through unofficial ways, such as cash or asphysical consumer goods, is not counted,"" said Nguyen Tri Hieu,a Hanoi-based economist and former government adviser.Many of the same networks which smuggle people also smugglecash, in return for commission.<p/>WEED AND NAILSAbout 70 percent of Vietnamese trafficking cases in Britainbetween 2009 and 2016 were related to labour exploitation, withmigrants lured into jobs growing cannabis illegally and workingin nail salons, Britain said last year.But many find legal work too, including in Europe, theUnited States and closer to home in Japan, Taiwan andneighbouring Laos.In Nghe An, which borders Laos, GDP per capita stands at$1,636, well below Vietnam national average of $2,540.""I didn't have enough money to go abroad so I went to Saigoninstead,"" said Bui Van Diep, a welder, using the old name for HoChi Minh City.He lives in a small shack in Do Thanh.

""I choseto go to the UK because the salary is very good and so manypeople from Do Thanh had already lived there.""Chung worked in a cannabis farm in Britain, and at aVietnamese-run nail salon where he said he earned around 500pounds ($640) a week.""The Vietnamese community living there help newcomers tofind jobs,"" Chung said. ""That why many people around here arewilling to even sell their land to raise enough money to go.""Now, he believes he made a huge mistake returning home.""I've lost a lot of money doing business here.

Border arrests hit 11-year high, U.S. seeks to expedite deportations	"By Julio-Cesar ChavezEL PASO, Texas (Reuters) - Immigration arrests at the U.S. border with Mexico soared 88 percent in fiscal 2019 in what U.S. officials on Tuesday labeled a crisis while unveiling their latest measure to combat the trend: expediting the deportation of asylum seekers.The number of people apprehended or turned away at the border actually fell in September to the lowest monthly total of the year, to 52,546, down 64% from a peak in May as migration typically slows during the hot summer months.But the total still rose 4% over the same month a year ago, and border arrests for the fiscal year ending in September reached an 11-year high.

Focused look at human trafficking could reveal better data, top US official says	"By Ellen WulfhorstWASHINGTON, Oct 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The UnitedStates could fight human trafficking effectively with morerefined measuring tools which could distinguish young victimsfrom old, or those trapped in domestic jobs from forced farmwork, its top anti-trafficking official said on Tuesday.Ambassador-at-Large John Richmond, speaking after atop-level government anti-trafficking commission meeting, saidtargeted questions investigating slavery could expose detailed -and possibly more useful - results.Some 24.9 million people around the world are estimated tobe victims of forced labor, working in factories or on buildingsites, farms and fishing boats, according to the United Nations'International Labour Organization.The ILO has called the estimate conservative.Counting and classifying people trapped in slavery in atargeted ""industry-specific and geographically restricted"" waycould refine results, such as distinguishing boys trafficked forsex from adults trafficked into farming, Richmond explained.""Instead of measuring how much trafficking is there inKenya, ask the question 'How much forced labor victims are inthe domestic workers' industry in metropolitan Nairobi?'"" hesaid by way of example.Diverse methods of measuring slavery would turn up ""adifferent set of questions, a different set of traffickers, adifferent set of victims, a different set of coercive means,""Richmond said.""I think we have some room to grow in terms of our ability,in terms of developing good methodologies around how to measurethe prevalence of trafficking.""""It would be really helpful as we move forward to figure out... what programs are actually having an impact.""Richmond, who took up his post at the end of 2018, serves asAmbassador-at-Large and leads the State Departmentanti-trafficking office.He spoke to reporters following a meeting of the PresidentInteragency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking inPersons, a cabinet-level group started in 2000.Top government officials including Secretary of State MikePompeo reported on progress and plans their departments andagencies have to fight human trafficking.Many detailed outreach and training efforts, plans to weedout forced labor in supply chains and support programs forsurvivors.The U.S. Congress approved an anti-trafficking program in2017 which it has funded with $75 million so far, with the aimof measuring the prevalence of trafficking, Richmond said.""My hope is just that more people would do studies and trydifferent methodologies and test them against each other,"" hesaid.

Italy to let French NGO migrant ship dock after 11 days at sea	"ROME, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Italy said on Tuesday it would leta French charity rescue ship disembark 104 migrants after thevessel spent 11 days at sea waiting for authorisation to dock.The interior ministry said in a statement that the OceanViking could head to the Sicilian port of Pozzallo, adding thatFrance and Germany had agreed to take in 70 of the migrants.French charities MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) and SOSMÃ©diterranÃ©e, which operate the ship, had issued an appeal onMonday asking Europe to designate a safe port for the migrantswho picked up off the Libyan coast on Oct. 18.Amongst those aboard are two pregnant women and 41 minorsunder the age of 18.""After days stranded at sea and having endured horrificconditions in Libya and during their journey, finally thesepeople will be brought to safety,"" said Michael Fark, the MSFhead of mission for Libya and the Mediterranean.MSF said an agreement had also been reached to let 90migrants aboard another Mediterranean rescue ship, the AlanKurdi, disembark. However, there was no immediate confirmationof this from Italy.German NGO Sea-Eye, which operates the Alan Kurdi, earlierreleased a video they said showed shots being fired in the airby a man on a boat flying a Libyan flag as they were pluckingmigrants from a dinghy on Saturday.League leader Matteo Salvini, who was Italy interiorminister for 14 months up until August, had closed Italian portsto charity ships, leaving boats stranded in the Mediterraneanfor many days awaiting authorisation to dock.Salvini denounced Tuesday decision to let the Ocean Vikingcome to port. ""Once again the Italian government has dropped itstrousers. Once again it is doing a favour to an NGO ... whichencourages human traffickers to ply their trade,"" he said.The League decision to quit the coalition opened the doorfor the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) to enter government.The PD has pushed for a more moderate immigration policy and haslooked to Europe to help share the strain.However, efforts to set up an automatic EU-wideredistribution system for migrants reaching Italy appears tohave floundered and MSF said it was ""sorry"" that only threecountries had agreed to take in the new arrivals.Salvini says the new government more welcoming approach toNGOs has led to an immediate spike in arrivals, with 2,498 boatmigrants reaching Italy in September against 947 in the samemonth last year and 1,854 people coming ashore so far this monthagainst 1,007 in all of October 2018.(Reporting by Crispian Balmer; Editing by Susan Fenton)"

Over 40 skulls found at altar in den of Mexico cartel suspects	MEXICO CITY, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Police found more than 40skulls, dozens of bones and a fetus in a glass jar next to analtar in the den of suspected drug traffickers in Mexico Cityduring a raid this week, authorities said on Sunday.Four of the skulls were built into the altar in the centralTepito neighborhood, where police arrested 31 people on Tuesdayon suspicion of drug cartel activity, the city government saidin a statement. A judge ordered 27 of the suspects released.A photo distributed by the Mexico City attorney generaloffice showed skulls clustered around the altar, which had across behind it adorned with a horned wooden face mask.To the right of the altar was a painted wall full of symbolsthat included a pyramid topped with a hand, celestial bodies andthe head of a goat with a hexagram between its horns, accordingto photos of the room published by local media.In front of the wall stood a variety of objects, includingdozens of wooden sticks with colored markings.A spokeswoman for the attorney general office saidauthorities were still investigating the provenance of theskulls, at least 42 of which had been found.Investigators also discovered knives, 40 jawbones, the fetusand 30 leg or arm bones at the site, the office said. It was notyet clear whether the fetus was human, the spokeswoman said.Tepito, north of the capital historic center, has longbeen known as a hotbed of illicit commercial activity.The release of nearly all the suspects arrested in the raidon the warren of hidden tunnels and suspected drug laboratoriesin Tepito was seen as a setback to the government, which hasbeen struggling to get a grip on chronic gang violence.(Reporting by Dave Graham and Diego Ore.

Islamic State's Baghdadi: a trail of horror and death	"By Ahmed Rasheed and Ahmed AbouleneinBAGHDAD (Reuters) - Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Iraqi jihadist who rose from obscurity to declare himself ""caliph"" of all Muslims as the leader of Islamic State, has died in a raid by U.S. special forces in northwest Syria.U.S. President Donald Trump said in a televised address from the White House that Baghdadi killed himself during the raid by igniting a suicide vest. Test results from the aftermath of the raid had positively identified Baghdadi, he said.Baghdadi had long been a target for U.S. and regional security forces trying to eliminate Islamic State, even as they reclaimed most of the territory the group once held.The Islamic State or caliphate that Baghdadi declared in July 2014 over a quarter of Iraq and Syria was notable for atrocities against religious minorities and attacks on five continents in the name of a version of an ultra-fanatic Islam that horrified mainstream Muslims.The genocide of Yazidis, adherents of one of the Middle East oldest religions, illustrated the brutality of his rule. Thousands of men were slaughtered on their ancestral Sinjar mountain in northwestern Iraq and women were killed or taken as sex slaves. Some other religious groups suffered sexual slavery, slaughter and floggings.The group also caused global revulsion with beheadings of hostages from countries including the United States, Britain and Japan.The United States put up a $25 million reward for his capture, the same amount as it had offered for al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and his successor Ayman al-Zawahri. U.S. air strikes had already killed most of Baghdadi top lieutenants, including Abu Omar al-Shishani, Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, Abu Ali al-Anbari, Abu Sayyaf and the group spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani. Thousands of his fighters were also killed or captured.Baghdadi was born Ibrahim Awad al-Samarrai in 1971 in Tobchi, a poor area nearÂ the town of Samarra, north of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, whose name he took. His family included preachers from the ultra-conservative Salafi school of Sunni Islam, which sees many other branches of the faith as heretical and other religions as anathema.He joined the Salafi jihadist insurgency in 2003, the year of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, and was captured by the Americans. They released him about a year later, thinking he was a civilian agitator rather than a military threat.It was not until July 4, 2014, that he seized the world attention, climbing the pulpit of Mosul medieval al-Nuri mosque in black clerical garb during Friday prayers to announce the restoration of the caliphate. ""God ordered us to fight his enemies,"" he said in a video of the occasion, which presented him as ""Caliph Ibrahim, commander of the faithful"". Thousands of volunteers flocked into Iraq and Syria from around the world to become ""Jund al-Khilafa"" - soldiers of the caliphate and join him in his fight against the Shi'ite-led  Iraqi government and its U.S. and Western allies. <p/>'MAKE THEIR BLOOD FLOW AS RIVERS'At the height of its power in 2016, Islamic State ruled over millions of people in territory running from northern Syria through towns and villages along the Tigris and Euphrates river valleys to the outskirts of Baghdad.The group claimed responsibility for or inspired attacks in dozens of cities including Paris, Nice, Orlando, Manchester, London and Berlin, and in nearby Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.In Iraq, it staged dozens of attacks on predominantly Shi'ite Muslim areas. A truck bomb in July 2016 killed more than 324 people in a crowded area of Baghdad, the deadliest attack since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.The group also carried out many bombings in northeast Syria, which has been under the control of U.S.-backed Kurdish forces.Most of Baghdadi speeches were distributed as audio recordings, a medium better suited to the secretive, careful character that for a long time helped him evade the surveillance and air strikes that killed more than 40 of his top commanders.That caution was matched by ruthlessness as he eliminated opponents and former allies, even within Salafi jihadist ranks. He waged war on al Qaeda Syrian wing, the Nusra Front, breaking with the movement global leader, al-Zawahri, in 2013.But by the time of his death in the raid this weekend, his fortunes - and those of Islamic State - were in rapid decline. With the defeat of Islamic State in its stronghold Mosul, which he declared as the capital of his caliphate, in 2017 the movement lost all the territory it once controlled in Iraq.In Syria, Islamic State lost Raqqa, its second capital and center of operations, and eventually earlier this year its final chunk of territory there when U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces took back Baghouz.<p/>STILL A THREATWhile the destruction of the quasi-state that Baghdadi built has denied the group its recruiting tool and logistical base from which it could train fighters and plan coordinated attacks overseas, most security experts believe Islamic State remains a threat through clandestine operations or attacks.Islamic State is believed to have sleeper cells around the world, and some fighters operate from the shadows in Syria desert and Iraq cities, still launching hit-and-run attacks.In his most recent audio message, in September, Baghdadi put on a brave face, saying operations were taking place daily and urging followers to secure freedom for women jailed in Iraq and Syria over their alleged links to the group.""As for the worst and most important matter, the prisons, the prisons, oh soldiers of the caliphate. Your brothers and sisters; do your utmost to free them and tear down the walls restricting them,"" Baghdadi said.But the loss of territory in Iraq and Syria stripped him of the trappings of caliph and made him a fugitive in the desert border area between the two countries.He was forced to travel incognito in ordinary cars or farm pick-up trucks between hideouts on both sides of the border, escorted only by his driver and two bodyguards. The region was familiar territory to his men. It was the hotbed of the Sunni insurgency against first the U.S. forces in Iraq and then the Shi'ite-led governments that took over the country.Fearing assassination or betrayal, he was not able to use phones and trusted only a handful of couriers to communicate with his two main Iraqi aides, Iyad al-Obaidi, his defense minister, and Ayad al-Jumaili, his security chief.The two had been believed to be among the likely candidates to succeed Baghdadi, but Jumaili was killed in April 2017 and Obaidi whereabouts are unknown. In any case, their military background and lack of religious credentials mean that any of Baghdadi deputies would struggle to inherit his claims to be caliph. <p/> (Reporting by Parisa Hafezi, Ahmed Rasheed, Khalil Ashawi, Ahmed Aboulenein, Raya Jalabi, Tom Perry; Editing by Samia Nakhoul, Frances Kerry and Alex Richardson)"
From bubble tea to disaster: How one Vietnamese dreamer apparently met her fate	"By James Pearson and Phuong NguyenHANOI (Reuters) - In Berlin she posed outside a beer garden, a beaming smile upon her face. In Brussels she sipped sugary bubble tea and posed on the steps of the old stock exchange.To anyone else, she was another tourist.But Vietnamese 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung, whose family believe she was one of the 39 people found dead in a refrigerated truck near London on Wednesday, it was the make-or-break trip of a lifetime.""Being grown up means having to hide your sadness in the dark, and keeping a smile on your face,"" Nhung wrote in an Oct. 21 Facebook post, days before her family lost contact with her and the news of the doomed shipping container emerged.From interviews with her family, and a series of messages left on her social media accounts, Reuters has pieced together the last movements of one of the young Vietnamese migrants thought by relatives to be among the dead.Nhung was from Nghe An, a poor province 300 km (190 miles) south of Hanoi, Vietnam rapidly developing capital. On Saturday evening, Catholic priest Anthony Dang Huu Nam led around 500 worshippers in prayers for the dead as they held lit candles in the modest, white-walled church in Yen Thanh, Nhung hometown.Many have made the same fateful journey. Britain ambassador to Vietnam wrote in an opinion piece published last month by local papers that the dangers were clear.""In recent years, hundreds of potential Vietnamese victims of trafficking have been identified in the UK,"" Ambassador Gareth Ward wrote in the Sept. 29 column.""There are cases of illegal immigrants suffering injuries when being chased. There are cases of death due to extreme cold, lack of oxygen inside lorries. Many never even set foot in the 'promised land',"" Ward wrote, referring to guarantees made by Vietnamese people smugglers to resettle migrants in Britain.Nhung family said she first left Nghe An on her journey overseas in August. She went to China first, before eventually making her way to Germany, then Belgium, where they believe she  boarded the fated truck. Officials in Britain have not yet identified the dead.""I just want a peaceful life,"" Nhung wrote in a caption beneath a photo of her smiling in a green field a few weeks after leaving Vietnam.""The happiest thing in life is finding someone who doesn't abandon you during your hardest time,"" she said, on Aug. 27.<p/>'LIVING FREELY'Late on Saturday night, Nhung family, devoid of hope, set up an altar in her memory, with her photo next to her father.Her father died of cancer a few years ago. Her mother was unable to work because of health complications and so her loved ones clubbed together to finance a new life overseas, Nhung family told Reuters.""Nhung didn't have the qualifications to get a good job with handsome pay. Nor do her friends and many others here,"" said Nhung uncle, Hoang Binh. ""Going abroad and sending back money was the only choice,"" he added.It was not clear what sort of work was lined up for Nhung.Some 70% of Vietnamese trafficking cases in the UK between 2009 and 2016 were for labor exploitation, including cannabis production and work in nail bars, according to a British government report last year.""Women and girls from rural areas are also considered more susceptible to trafficking,"" the report said.By early September, it was not clear where she was, but Nhung was already well into her trip, and reflecting on her next steps.Beside a stock image of two children flying kites at sunset, she posted: ""As I grow up, I see that life is not as peaceful as I used to think. When I grow up, I want to go back to my childhood, when I lived freely"".<p/>PINK TO BLACKIn one of her first pictures more clearly taken from the start of her adventure in Europe, Nhung posed in front of a German beer garden. Days later, in late September, she posted photos of Vietnamese noodle dishes she said she had cooked for friends in Berlin.""If anyone wants to buy one, I'll ship it to you,"" she joked in the Facebook post.Ton Quang Tuan, one of Nhung friends living in Berlin, said that ""We went out a few times when Nhung was in Berlin"" and added that ""she was in a good mood, very happy,"" but they lost contact after she said she had to leave for Britain.It was not clear how Nhung had traveled from the Vietnamese countryside to China and then Berlin, but the German capital has emerged in recent years as a staging ground for Vietnamese and other migrants looking to start new lives in Britain.""I feel lonely in the place I used to dream of everyday,"" Nhung wrote on Sept. 25. It was unclear where she was - Vietnamese smugglers are said to advise their subjects to live discreetly and not to give away too many clues in order to evade detection from the authorities.""I don't know when I can get used to my current life, but I do know one thing for sure. At this moment, I miss you dad. I miss you like crazy.""A few days later, Nhung was pictured outside Berlin Cathedral with a cup of bubble tea in her hands. The sweetened, milky tea filled with balls of chewy jelly is hugely popular amongst Vietnamese youth.By late October, Nhung was in Belgium. She posted photos of herself, again with a cup of bubble tea in her hand, excitedly exploring the sights of Brussels, including the old stock exchange and the bustling Rue Auguste Orts thoroughfare.It was from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge that the doomed container eventually departed. Her family believe that she was on board.In Berlin, Nhung wrote:""Back in Vietnam, I thought Europe was pink"".""But it turns out it black"".<p/> (Reporting by James Pearson and Phuong Nguyen; Additional reporting by Tom Bergin in London; Editing by Frances Kerry)"
'Grass' or 'VIP'? How rural Vietnamese make treacherous journey to Europe	"By James Pearson and Phuong NguyenHANOI (Reuters) - For Vietnamese seeking to embark on the treacherous journey to a new life in Europe, a key question can be: ""Grass"" or ""VIP""?People-smugglers offer different levels of service at vastly different prices, anti-trafficking experts, migrants and their family members told Reuters.""If he took the 'VIP' route, there a 1% chance he was captured. It the safest and most expensive route,"" said Nguyen Dinh Gia, who fears his son Nguyen Dinh Luong was among 39 migrants found dead in a truck container near London last week. Most are believed to have been Vietnamese.""If he took the grass route, I'm 100 percent sure he died,"" Gia said. ""The vehicle in this incident ... that the grass route.""Many trafficked Vietnamese end up working in illegal cannabis farms in Britain but ""grass"" in this case is a slang word used in Vietnam to describe something as dirt cheap.That option, which involves travelling from the Southeast Asian country overland to Europe, means arduous months of secretive movement by car and even walking.""They'll often go from Vietnam into China, and then cross into Russia,"" said Mimi Vu, an independent anti-trafficking advocate based in Ho Chi Minh City.    ""This is usually done by automobile, and then they'll go from Russia into one of the neighbouring countries like Ukraine or Latvia on foot, crossing forests and mountains only at night."" Taking the ""VIP"" route typically involves using fake or recycled passports to fly from Vietnam to Europe via a third country in a process that takes days instead of months, but comes at a much higher cost, she added.""He said, if I take the 'grass' route, it costs 3,000 pounds to go from France to Britain. But if he takes the 'VIP' route, it'll cost 11,000 pounds,"" Gia said of his 20-year-old son.Several migrants, their families and experts gave the 11,000 pounds ($14,000) figure as the going rate to be smuggled from Germany or France to Britain.""Luong told me he chose the 'VIP' route, so I don't understand how he ended up on this path,"" Gia added.<p/>UNDERGROUND JOURNEYThat could be because there was no ""VIP"" route for Luong sea crossing from mainland Europe into Britain.However Vietnamese migrants arrive in Europe, stowing away on a container truck is the only way to take that final step across the Channel, migrants and anti-trafficking experts said. ""Parents pay for the 'VIP' service because they think it'll be safer but what they don't realise is that their son or daughter will end up in the same container truck as someone who paid for the cheap journey,"" said Vu.Luong father said he had tried to persuade his son, whose ""grass"" route had taken him across Asia to Russia in October 2017, then Ukraine, where he lived with other migrants in a warehouse for six months, not to press on. ""He said in Britain it more fun and that there a community there,"" Nguyen Dinh Gia said.In April 2018, Luong arrived in Germany, the premier staging ground for Vietnamese migrants in Europe.""Most of the time he moved by vehicle to get there, but he also had to walk about seven hours,"" Gia said of Luong trip.The heart of Germany Vietnamese community is the Dong Xuan Centre in east Berlin, a vast wholesale market which an investigation this year by the city public TV station found was also a hub for people smuggling. Berlin city police confirmed the report main findings.Covering an area the size of several soccer fields, the Centre is packed with Vietnamese nail studios, hairdressers, food halls, textile sellers and cafes.

How rural Vietnamese make treacherous journey to Europe	"By James Pearson and Phuong NguyenHANOI (Reuters) - For Vietnamese seeking to embark on the treacherous journey to a new life in Europe, a key question can be: ""Grass"" or ""VIP""?People-smugglers offer different levels of service at vastly different prices, anti-trafficking experts, migrants and their family members told Reuters.""If he took the 'VIP' route, there a 1% chance he was captured. It the safest and most expensive route,"" said Nguyen Dinh Gia, who fears his son Nguyen Dinh Luong was among 39 migrants found dead in a truck container near London last week. Most are believed to have been Vietnamese.""If he took the grass route, I'm 100 percent sure he died,"" Gia said. ""The vehicle in this incident ... that the grass route.""Many trafficked Vietnamese end up working in illegal cannabis farms in Britain but ""grass"" in this case is a slang word used in Vietnam to describe something as dirt cheap.That option, which involves traveling from the Southeast Asian country overland to Europe, means arduous months of secretive movement by car and even walking.""They'll often go from Vietnam into China, and then cross into Russia,"" said Mimi Vu, an independent anti-trafficking advocate based in Ho Chi Minh City.    ""This is usually done by automobile, and then they'll go from Russia into one of the neighboring countries like Ukraine or Latvia on foot, crossing forests and mountains only at night."" Taking the ""VIP"" route typically involves using fake or recycled passports to fly from Vietnam to Europe via a third country in a process that takes days instead of months, but comes at a much higher cost, she added.""He said, if I take the 'grass' route, it costs 3,000 pounds to go from France to Britain. But if he takes the 'VIP' route, it'll cost 11,000 pounds,"" Gia said of his 20-year-old son.Several migrants, their families and experts gave the 11,000 pounds ($14,000) figure as the going rate to be smuggled from Germany or France to Britain.""Luong told me he chose the 'VIP' route, so I don't understand how he ended up on this path,"" Gia added.<p/>UNDERGROUND JOURNEYThat could be because there was no ""VIP"" route for Luong sea crossing from mainland Europe into Britain.However Vietnamese migrants arrive in Europe, stowing away on a container truck is the only way to take that final step across the Channel, migrants and anti-trafficking experts said. ""Parents pay for the 'VIP' service because they think it'll be safer but what they don't realize is that their son or daughter will end up in the same container truck as someone who paid for the cheap journey,"" said Vu.Luong father said he had tried to persuade his son, whose ""grass"" route had taken him across Asia to Russia in October 2017, then Ukraine, where he lived with other migrants in a warehouse for six months, not to press on. ""He said in Britain it more fun and that there a community there,"" Nguyen Dinh Gia said.In April 2018, Luong arrived in Germany, the premier staging ground for Vietnamese migrants in Europe.""Most of the time he moved by vehicle to get there, but he also had to walk about seven hours,"" Gia said of Luong trip.The heart of Germany Vietnamese community is the Dong Xuan Center in east Berlin, a vast wholesale market which an investigation this year by the city public TV station found was also a hub for people smuggling. Berlin city police confirmed the report main findings.Covering an area the size of several soccer fields, the Center is packed with Vietnamese nail studios, hairdressers, food halls, textile sellers and cafes. At lunchtime on Sunday it was bustling with locals, Asians and eastern Europeans shopping or sharing a meal.The administrative office by the Center entrance was closed and nobody picked up the phone at the number advertised on the door.<p/>TRANSFER CHAINJourneys made by Vietnamese migrants are often broken up into stages, at the end of which traffickers request cash from families before they can proceed further.When Luong traveled to France from Germany, his father was asked to pay $18,000 in cash for the trip so far.""Someone called me and a guy showed up in a vehicle and took the money,"" Gia said. ""He was a man, about 30 years old.""""When Luong called home to say he had arrived safely, that was the signal for us to prepare money.""Luong lived in France for almost 18 months, working illegally in a restaurant there.Bui Thac, whose nephew Bui Phan Thang is feared among the container dead, said debt collectors in Vietnam often hide their faces when receiving cash from families.""Sometimes they ask to meet at a or near a bus stop to receive money,"" said Thac. ""They have their own money transfer chain, which doesn't touch the banks.""Having paid his way to mainland Europe and, despite his father wishes, Luong embarked on his final journey to Britain.Late on Thursday night, Gia received a call from a contact overseas with direct knowledge of the fatal container accident.""I hope you understand. The vehicle was in an accident,"" Luong father recalled the contact saying.

OBITUARY-Islamic State's Baghdadi: a trail of horror and death	"By Ahmed Rasheed and Ahmed AbouleneinBAGHDAD, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Iraqijihadist who rose from obscurity to declare himself ""caliph"" ofall Muslims as the leader of Islamic State, has died in a raidby U.S. special forces in northwest Syria.U.S. President Donald Trump said in a televised address fromthe White House that Baghdadi killed himself during the raid byigniting a suicide vest. Test results from the aftermath of theraid had positively identified Baghdadi, he said.Baghdadi had long been a target for U.S. and regionalsecurity forces trying to eliminate Islamic State, even as theyreclaimed most of the territory the group once held.The Islamic State or caliphate that Baghdadi declared inJuly 2014 over a quarter of Iraq and Syria was notable foratrocities against religious minorities and attacks on fivecontinents in the name of a version of an ultra-fanatic Islamthat horrified mainstream Muslims.The genocide of Yazidis, adherents of one of the MiddleEast oldest religions, illustrated the brutality of his rule.Thousands of men were slaughtered on their ancestral Sinjarmountain in northwestern Iraq and women were killed or taken assex slaves. Some other religious groups suffered sexual slavery,slaughter and floggings.The group also caused global revulsion with beheadings ofhostages from countries including the United States, Britain andJapan.The United States put up a $25 million reward for hiscapture, the same amount as it had offered for al Qaeda leaderOsama bin Laden and his successor Ayman al-Zawahri.U.S. air strikes had already killed most of Baghdadi toplieutenants, including Abu Omar al-Shishani, Abu Muslimal-Turkmani, Abu Ali al-Anbari, Abu Sayyaf and the groupspokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani. Thousands of his fighters werealso killed or captured.Baghdadi was born Ibrahim Awad al-Samarrai in 1971 inTobchi, a poor area near the town of Samarra, north of the Iraqicapital Baghdad, whose name he took.His family included preachers from the ultra-conservativeSalafi school of Sunni Islam, which sees many other branches ofthe faith as heretical and other religions as anathema.He joined the Salafi jihadist insurgency in 2003, the yearof the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, and was captured by theAmericans. They released him about a year later, thinking he wasa civilian agitator rather than a military threat.It was not until July 4, 2014, that he seized the worldattention, climbing the pulpit of Mosul medieval al-Nurimosque in black clerical garb during Friday prayers to announcethe restoration of the caliphate.""God ordered us to fight his enemies,"" he said in a video ofthe occasion, which presented him as ""Caliph Ibrahim, commanderof the faithful"".Thousands of volunteers flocked into Iraq and Syria fromaround the world to become ""Jund al-Khilafa"" - soldiers of thecaliphate and join him in his fight against the Shi'ite-ledIraqi government and its U.S. and Western allies.<p/>'MAKE THEIR BLOOD FLOW AS RIVERS'At the height of its power in 2016, Islamic State ruled overmillions of people in territory running from northern Syriathrough towns and villages along the Tigris and Euphrates rivervalleys to the outskirts of Baghdad.The group claimed responsibility for or inspired attacks indozens of cities including Paris, Nice, Orlando, Manchester,London and Berlin, and in nearby Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia andEgypt.In Iraq, it staged dozens of attacks on predominantlyShi'ite Muslim areas. A truck bomb in July 2016 killed more than324 people in a crowded area of Baghdad, the deadliest attacksince the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.The group also carried out many bombings in northeast Syria,which has been under the control of U.S.-backed Kurdish forces.Most of Baghdadi speeches were distributed as audiorecordings, a medium better suited to the secretive, carefulcharacter that for a long time helped him evade the surveillanceand air strikes that killed more than 40 of his top commanders.That caution was matched by ruthlessness as he eliminatedopponents and former allies, even within Salafi jihadist ranks.He waged war on al Qaeda Syrian wing, the Nusra Front,breaking with the movement global leader, al-Zawahri, in 2013.But by the time of his death in the raid this weekend, hisfortunes - and those of Islamic State - were in rapid decline.With the defeat of Islamic State in its stronghold Mosul,which he declared as the capital of his caliphate, in 2017 themovement lost all the territory it once controlled in Iraq.In Syria, Islamic State lost Raqqa, its second capital andcentre of operations, and eventually earlier this year its finalchunk of territory there when U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forcestook back Baghouz.<p/>STILL A THREATWhile the destruction of the quasi-state that Baghdadi builthas denied the group its recruiting tool and logistical basefrom which it could train fighters and plan coordinated attacksoverseas, most security experts believe Islamic State remains athreat through clandestine operations or attacks.Islamic State is believed to have sleeper cells around theworld, and some fighters operate from the shadows in Syriadesert and Iraq cities, still launching hit-and-run attacks.In his most recent audio message, in September, Baghdadi puton a brave face, saying operations were taking place daily andurging followers to secure freedom for women jailed in Iraq andSyria over their alleged links to the group.""As for the worst and most important matter, the prisons,the prisons, oh soldiers of the caliphate. Your brothers andsisters; do your utmost to free them and tear down the wallsrestricting them,"" Baghdadi said.But the loss of territory in Iraq and Syria stripped him ofthe trappings of caliph and made him a fugitive in the desertborder area between the two countries.He was forced to travel incognito in ordinary cars or farmpick-up trucks between hideouts on both sides of the border,escorted only by his driver and two bodyguards.The region was familiar territory to his men. It was thehotbed of the Sunni insurgency against first the U.S. forces inIraq and then the Shi'ite-led governments that took over thecountry.Fearing assassination or betrayal, he was not able to usephones and trusted only a handful of couriers to communicatewith his two main Iraqi aides, Iyad al-Obaidi, his defenceminister, and Ayad al-Jumaili, his security chief.The two had been believed to be among the likely candidatesto succeed Baghdadi, but Jumaili was killed in April 2017 andObaidi whereabouts are unknown.In any case, their military background and lack of religiouscredentials mean that any of Baghdadi deputies would struggleto inherit his claims to be caliph.(Reporting by Parisa Hafezi, Ahmed Rasheed, Khalil Ashawi,Ahmed Aboulenein, Raya Jalabi, Tom PerryEditing by Samia Nakhoul, Frances Kerry and Alex Richardson)"
Vietnam police take DNA from relatives of suspected truck victims	"CAN LOC, Vietnam (Reuters) - Police in Vietnam took hair and blood samples on Sunday to get DNA from relatives of people feared to be among the 39 who died in the back of a truck near London last week, their family members said.The bodies were found on Wednesday in a truck container in Grays, about 32 km (20 miles) east of central London and British police are still trying to establish the identity of victims who in many cases lacked identity documents.In a poor rice-growing area of northern Vietnam, communities have been plunged into mourning with their hope all but lost for relatives who had set out to seek better lives in Europe and were thought to have been aboard the truck.The hashtag #RIP39 was trending in Vietnam on widely-used Facebook.Distraught, Nguyen Dinh Gia said he feared there was very little chance he would ever again see his 20-year-old son, Nguyen Dinh Luong, who had been trying to get to Britain after first making it to France.""Police from the Ministry of Public Security came to get DNA samples, our hair and blood,"" Nguyen Dinh Gia told Reuters at Can Loc in Ha Tinh province, where sympathizers gathered at the simple house amid lush rice fields to console the family.""I advised him not to go because I told him that even though our family had always had nothing and our children were always in hardship, but we brought them up just fine,"" Nguyen said.The father of Pham Thi Tra My, who sent a last text message to her family in the early hours of Wednesday Vietnam time, said police had also been to collect samples of blood and hair.Vietnam government did not respond immediately for a request for comment.

All three had been questioned on suspicion of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people.Initially, British police believed the victims were Chinese, but later sought help from the Vietnamese community.

Honduran inmate who linked president's brother to drug deals killed	"By Gustavo PalenciaTEGUCIGALPA, Oct 26 (Reuters) - An alleged drug dealer withknowledge of drug shipments involving a brother of HonduranPresident Juan Orlando Hernandez convicted this month for drugtrafficking, was killed on Saturday in prison, his lawyer said.Magdaleno Meza, who had been in the El Pozo prison sinceJune 2018 on charges of money laundering, was shot dead during afight between inmates of the facility, the deputy director ofthe national penal authority, German McNiel, told reporters.Meza lawyer, Carlos Chajtur, told Reuters his client wasattacked by two armed men trying to stop him from talking aboutthe information about drug deals he had in several notebooks incase he was called to testify in the United States.Security camera footage purportedly of the killing publishedby Honduran newspaper El Heraldo showed a man being shot andthen repeatedly stabbed by a group of men inside the prison some100 miles (160 km) northwest of the capital Tegucigalpa.Politician Juan Antonio ""Tony"" Hernandez was found guilty ofU.S. drug trafficking charges on Oct. 18 after a two-week trialthat featured accusations of corruption against his brother,president Juan Orlando, who denied the allegations.During the U.S. trial, a witness testified that TonyHernandez promised now-captive Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""ElChapo"" Guzman protection for his shipments in exchange for a $1million donation to his brother 2013 presidential campaign.Juan Orlando Hernandez has not been charged with any crime.Authorities seized the notebooks from Meza when he wasarrested in 2018 on suspicion of narcotics trafficking. Thenotebooks had information linking Tony Hernandez to drug deals,according to documents from the attorney general office.Chajtur said the notebooks were used in evidence at thetrial of Tony Hernandez, and that the information therein alsocontained coded references to Juan Orlando Hernandez.The lawyer said he had made repeated requests that Mezaclient be transferred to a more high security location due tothreats that were made against his life.""We never got an answer to our requests, which makes usthink the government was involved in this act,"" he said.The president office had no immediate comment.(Additional reporting by Diego OreEditing by Dave Graham and Sandra Maler)"
From bubble tea to disaster: How one Vietnamese dreamer apparently met her fate	"By James Pearson and Phuong NguyenHANOI (Reuters) - In Berlin she posed outside a beer garden, a beaming smile upon her face. In Brussels she sipped sugary bubble tea and posed on the steps of the old stock exchange.To anyone else, she was another tourist.But Vietnamese 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung, whose family believe she was one of the 39 people found dead in a refrigerated truck near London on Wednesday, it was the make-or-break trip of a lifetime.""Being grown up means having to hide your sadness in the dark, and keeping a smile on your face,"" Nhung wrote in an Oct. 21 Facebook post, days before her family lost contact with her and the news of the doomed shipping container emerged.From interviews with her family, and a series of messages left on her social media accounts, Reuters has pieced together the last movements of one of the young Vietnamese migrants thought by relatives to be among the dead.Nhung was from Nghe An, a poor province 300 km (190 miles) south of Hanoi, Vietnam rapidly developing capital. On Saturday evening, Catholic priest Anthony Dang Huu Nam led around 500 worshippers in prayers for the dead as they held lit candles in the modest, white-walled church in Yen Thanh, Nhung hometown.Many have made the same fateful journey. Britain ambassador to Vietnam wrote in an opinion piece published last month by local papers that the dangers were clear.""In recent years, hundreds of potential Vietnamese victims of trafficking have been identified in the UK,"" Ambassador Gareth Ward wrote in the Sept. 29 column.""There are cases of illegal immigrants suffering injuries when being chased. There are cases of death due to extreme cold, lack of oxygen inside lorries.

El Chapo's son led dramatic rescue of his half brother in Mexico battle	"By Anthony Esposito and Ana Isabel MartinezMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Ivan Archivaldo Guzman, the leader of Los Chapitos wing of the Sinaloa Cartel, was behind the assault on security forces that prompted the release of his half-brother from a house in the city of Culiacan last week, a top Mexican official said.The men father is Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, Mexico most infamous drug kingpin, who himself slipped away from authorities on multiple occasions before being sentenced to life imprisonment in the United States this year. Younger brother Ovidio Guzman was briefly captured by Mexican security forces on Oct. 17 in an upscale neighborhood of Culiacan, until hundreds of heavily-armed Sinaloa Cartel gunmen forced his release. The botched raid has called into question Mexico security strategy and put pressure on President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has insisted that the release was necessary to protect the lives of civilians and security personnel.Questions have circulated about the role of the older Guzman brother in launching the fierce counterattack led by gunmen in armored vehicles armed with mounted weapons that left parts of the city smoldering. Late on Thursday, Security Minister Alfonso Durazo said Ivan Archivaldo had played a key part.""He was one of those leading the mobilization of various criminal elements in Culiacan,"" Durazo said, while denying reports that the elder brother had also been briefly captured. ""Ivan Archivaldo was not at the home that was taken over by (security) personnel who participated in this operation,"" he said.A senior security official told Reuters that Ovidio was found in the house with his partner, their two daughters, and two guards. The official asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media.The Sinaloa Cartel, along with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, are Mexico largest and most powerful drug trafficking organizations.Since El Chapo left the scene, his partner Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada has taken on a coordinating ""godfather"" role overseeing several factions in the organization, an official at the U.S. Justice Department told Reuters.Four brothers, led by Ivan Archivaldo, form one group collectively known as Los Chapitos, or ""little Chapos."" El Chapo brother heads another unit, and veteran trafficker Rafael Caro-Quintero leads another, the official said.

UK truck deaths highlight shift in migrant route after closure of French camp	"By Marine  Strauss and Philip BlenkinsopBRUSSELS (Reuters) - When France shut the Calais shanty town known as the Jungle in 2016, migrants seeking entry to Britain were forced to look for less safe passage up the coast in Belgium - the route taken by a truck in which 39 bodies were found this week.Belgium federal prosecutors, who handle cases of terrorism and organized crime, said on Thursday they had opened an investigation into the deadly transport. Initial findings showed the truck passed through the Belgian cargo port of Zeebrugge, from where it crossed by ferry to Britain.The victims - 31 men and eight women, all believed to be Chinese nationals - were found in a refrigerated truck on an industrial estate 20 miles (32 km) east of London. The driver was detained on suspicion of murder.Belgian prosecutors said they were looking into when and where the victims were loaded into the container. Regional British police said a case of human trafficking was suspected.This was not the first fatal migrant transport routed through Zeebrugge - a container with the bodies of 58 Chinese inside found in the English port of Dover in 2000 had also come from the Belgian port.However, in recent years the focus of migrant efforts to reach Britain was the French port of Calais - across the Channel from Dover - offering more than hourly ferry services and an undersea tunnel on the shortest crossing to the United Kingdom.The migrant community in Calais grew to some 6,000 people, most of them in a shanty town dubbed the Jungle, outside Calais until French authorities emptied it in October 2016, saying it was a security and health hazard.Cast adrift and driven away from Calais by the Jungle closure, many migrants looking for the next closest passage points made their way north to neighboring Belgium, said Stef Janssens at that country federal center of migration.<p/>MIGRANT ROUTE SHIFTS""There was a shift of the route to Britain from Calais to Belgium E40 highway,"" he said, with people trafficking gangs taking control of parking spots where migrants congregate along the motorway leading from Brussels to the North Sea coast.In contrast with Calais, Zeebrugge largely handles cargo with far fewer leisure travelers. Dogs and heat scanners are used to detect stowaways though they might not be spotted in sealed, refrigerated containers like the one in which the 39 bodies were discovered this week.In 2014, an Afghan migrant was found dead in a container that had arrived in the British port of Tilbury, along with 34 who had survived. This also had gone through Zeebrugge, but at a time when the scanner was not working. ""If they had to open up every container or every truck... there would be trucks (queued up) from here to Brussels. Every day there are 4,000 trucks coming to this port,"" Dirk de Fauw, mayor of the city of Bruges and chairman of adjacent Zeebrugge, told Reuters television.Smugglers remain on the E40 motorway, Janssens said, but in their hunt for spots with weaker port controls and security, they had headed even further north in the past two years.""This has also shifted to Antwerp and ports such as Hook of Holland in the Netherlands because these ports are used less and subject to lesser controls,"" Janssens said.Smuggling migrants is lucrative, he said, with migrants charged up to 6,000 euros ($6,690) for ""guaranteed"" passage to Britain.The Geneva-based International Organization for Migration (IOM) says it has noted a trend in the past year of increasing numbers of migrants also trying to cross to Britain in small boats.

Bulgaria elects sole candidate for new chief prosecutor amid protests	"By Tsvetelia TsolovaSOFIA, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Bulgaria top judicial body onThursday elected the sole candidate for the next chiefprosecutor in a process lacking competition that raisedquestions whether nominee Ivan Geshev would wage a genuine waron high-level corruption.After a ten-hour hearing and a hoax bomb threat, the SupremeJudicial Council voted 20-4 for Geshev, currently deputy chiefprosecutor, to take up the top job for seven years.The powerful position is key to combating graft in Bulgaria,ranked as the most corrupt member state in the European Union bythe watchdog Transparency International.""Although we had just one candidate, this is the mostdisputed choice for a chief prosecutor so far,"" said AntonStankov, a lawyer and a former justice minister.The vote was held a day after over 1,000 people marched incentral Sofia to protest at the 48-year-old Geshev promotion.On Thursday, protesters blocked two major boulevards inSofia for hours after they were not allowed near the Councilbuilding, where Geshev supporters held up banners reading""Geshev - the People Sheriff"" and ""Worthy Chief Prosecutor"".The lack of competition for the post angered many in thecapital, who see Geshev election as a pre-determined outcomeof a deal between graft-prone political elites and localoligarchs.Geshev holds a law degree from a police academy and has beena prosecutor since 2006.Prosecutors, police and investigators have praised Geshevsuccesses in cracking down on crime gangs involved in bankingcard scams, migrant trafficking and cigarette smuggling inrecent years and his zeal in chasing offenders.Critics argue that quiet support for his nomination by thepolitical establishment indicated Geshev would not go afterelites and might use his powers to target rivals and opponents.At the hearing, Geshev denied all accusations and said theprocess for his election was fully transparent.""I will not allow media, political or economic circles toindicate who is to be charged and what is more, on whatcharges,"" Geshev said at his hearing before the vote.The chief prosecutor is one of the most powerful positionsin Bulgaria with wide powers to launch and stop investigations.<p/>Despite a declared political will to uproot graft, Sofia hasyet to jail a high-ranking official on corruption charges.Failure to deliver results on fighting graft is keeping thecountry outside the EU Schengen passport-free travel zone,curbs foreign investment and is one of the obstacles toBulgaria push to adopt the euro currency.(Reporting by Tsvetelia TsolovaEditing by Mark Heinrich)"

Greece moves more migrants to mainland, warns others to stay away	"By Angeliki KoutantouATHENS (Reuters) - Greek authorities moved more refugees and migrants from overcrowded island camps to the mainland on Tuesday as the government, facing a surge in new arrivals, said it would take a hardline on those who did not qualify for asylum.Nearly 700 migrants and refugees arrived in the port of Elefsina near Athens from the island of Samos, officials said. Earlier, 120 people arrived from Lesbos at Greece main port, Pireaus.    Greece is struggling with the biggest resurgence in refugee and migrant flows across the Aegean Sea from Turkey since 2015, when more than a million crossed into Europe, many of them via Greece.    The islands, which are closest to Turkey, have been struggling under the influx, with some 33,700 refugees and migrants in overcrowded camps, according to the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR.In late September, a woman died in a fire in a tent in a camp on Lesbos, while a fire in an overcrowded camp in Samos forced hundreds of people into the streets this month.""Our focus was mainly on Samos because we want things there to calm down,"" migration ministry secretary Manos Logothetis told Reuters.<p/>LOSING MONEYGreece has adopted a tougher stance on migration since the conservative government led by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis came to power in July.Mitsotakis told his EU counterparts last week that the union must review asylum rules and warned economic migrants that they will be returned to Turkey if they are not entitled to asylum, government spokesman Stelios Petsas said on Tuesday. ""If they give their money to traffickers hoping to permanently cross into Europe, they will only lose it,"" Petsas told reporters. ""Even if they reach Greece, since they are not entitled to asylum, they will return to Turkey.""""They can no longer come to Greece and apply for asylum hoping that they stay here forever, as it was the case with the previous government,"" Petsas said, referring to former prime minister Alexis Tsipras' left-led administration.   More than 12,000 people arrived in Greece in September, the highest level in the three-and-a-half years since the EU agreed a deal with Turkey to seal the Aegean corridor to Europe.Athens has announced plans to deport 10,000 people who do not qualify for asylum by the end of next year.Logothetis said up to 300 more people would be leaving Samos this week, and up to 2,000 from all outlying islands next week. Greece aims to move up to 20,000 off the islands by the end of the year, he said.<p/> (Reporting by Angeliki Koutantou; writing by Renee Maltezou; editing by Angus MacSwan)"

""We arefighting insecurity.""The convoys of army trucks with mounted machine gunsrumbling through Culiacan streets were meant to instillconfidence. However, a national poll on Monday showed two thirdsof respondents believe drug lords and mobsters are more powerfulthan the government after the gunbattles last week that forcedan army retreat.Sinaloa public safety director Cristobal Castaneda told newsanchor Joaquin Lopez Doriga that 13 people were killed duringthe disturbances that ran late into Thursday night.President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has insisted thedecision to release Ovidio Guzman was the only way to save livesafter cartel henchmen erected roadblocks, torched trucks andopened fire with heavy, military-style weapons.After a telephone call with U.S. President Donald Trump overthe weekend, Mexican Cabinet ministers met U.S. AmbassadorChristopher Landau to ask for help stemming the flow of weaponsbought legally in the United States and sold to cartels south ofthe border.""We both agreed to move quickly to share information anddeliver specific results,"" the U.S. Embassy in Mexico said onTwitter, calling it Operation Frozen.

The months of July through September were the threemost violent in 2018.Even so, the number of murders remains on track to surpasslast year record total of 29,000.One poll released on Monday showed opinion was split overthe operation in Culiacan. A survey by newspaper Reforma said49% disagreed with the release of the younger Guzman after hisbrief arrest by military police versus 45% who backed it.A separate survey by polling firm GCE put the numbers at54%-34% against letting him go.

Spanish PM visits Barcelona, criticises regional chief	"By Joan Faus and Jordi RubioBARCELONA (Reuters) - Spain acting prime minister Pedro Sanchez made a quick visit to Catalonia on Monday after a week of separatist unrest but spurned the pro-independence regional chief, accusing him of failing in his duty to restore order.The northeastern region has been hit by seven consecutive nights of sometimes violent protests following the jailing last week of nine Catalan separatists found guilty of sedition over their role in leading a failed 2017 bid for independence.The atmosphere was generally calmer on Monday, as several hundred people gathered in front of the Catalan Interior Ministry.

Fidelity drops Fisher's money management firm as withdrawals accelerate	"By Ross KerberBOSTON (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments has dropped Fisher Investments as a money manager, a Fidelity spokesman said on Monday, the latest in an accelerating series of withdrawals from the firm over allegedly sexist comments by its leader, Kenneth Fisher.Fisher had managed $500 million in the $8 billion Fidelity Strategic Advisers Small-Mid Cap Fund &lt;FNAPX.O&gt;, a mandate the Boston firm said last week was under review. Since then a set of public pension funds also pulled money from Fisher, including funds in Iowa and in the cities of Boston and Philadelphia, bringing total withdrawals to around $1.8 billion. Other systems have Fisher under review including in Florida and Los Angeles.Fisher did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In a video posted Oct. 9 on Twitter, Alex Chalekian, chief executive of a financial advisory firm, called attention to comments Fisher made at a financial conference last week.Chalekian said Fisher made derogatory comments about genitalia, picking up girls and financier Jeffrey Epstein, among other topics. Epstein committed suicide in August while in jail awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.In a memo to his firm employees on Oct. 11 and sent to Reuters by a spokesman, Fisher said: ""It pains me to know that my comments have caused you grief, concern, and indignation. I sincerely apologize.""At Fidelity, assets previously managed by Fisher have been reallocated within the fund, said Fidelity spokesman Vincent Loporchio. <p/> (Reporting by Ross Kerber in Boston; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Matthew Lewis)"

UPDATE 3-Trump, Lopez Obrador agree to take action to stem flow of weapons to Mexico	"(Adds comments from Mexico foreign minister, background)By Anthony EspositoMEXICO CITY, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Mexico foreign ministersaid on Saturday that President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador andhis U.S. counterpart Donald Trump had agreed to take swiftaction to stem the flow of illegal weapons from the UnitedStates into Mexico, where a drug war is raging.Lopez Obrador told Trump on a phone call that he proposed""both countries use technology to close the border, to freezethe traffic of arms that is killing people in Mexico,"" ForeignMinister Marcelo Ebrard told reporters.""And Trump responded that he thought it was a good idea thatthis could be done using technology,"" Ebrard said, adding thatthe idea is to install at all border crossings advanced lasers,X-rays and metal detectors, capable of even detecting chemicalproducts.Not only could that staunch the flow of illegal weapons intoMexico, but also the trafficked drugs into the United States,said Ebrard.Increasing the number of Mexican intelligence agents in theUnited States is another proposal that is on the table.Lopez Obrador told Trump ""he was very concerned"" that gangmembers used .50 caliber, armor-piercing rifles during thebreakout of violence in the northwestern city of Culiacan overthe attempted arrest of Ovidio Guzman, a son of jailed drug lordJoaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.Mexico estimates that upwards of 80% of the weapons used bycriminals in Mexico enter from the United States, and has longlobbied U.S. officials to take gun trafficking more seriously,arguing that the number of guns in the country make it muchharder to clamp down on drug traffickers.Ebrard assured there was no need to change laws in theUnited States in order to stop the illegal flow of weapons intoMexico.Gun control of any kind is a hot button issue in the UnitedStates ahead of 2020 elections and could face resistance fromthe gun lobby, especially the powerful National RifleAssociation lobby group which has strongly resisted restrictionsafter recent U.S. mass shootings.The two leaders agreed that U.S. and Mexican officials wouldmeet in the next few days to discuss options, and would announceactions to ""freeze"" illegal imports of weapons into Mexicothrough U.S. border crossings.There was no immediate comment from U.S. authorities.The discussion came in the wake of the bungled arrestattempt. Cartel gunmen surrounded about 35 police and nationalguard on Thursday in the capital of Sinaloa state and made themfree Ovidio Guzman. His brief detention had set off widespreadgun battles and a jailbreak that stunned the country.""If the order would have been given to continue with theoperation in Culiacan we estimate that more than 200 people,mostly civilians, would have been killed,"" said Ebrard, addingthat so-called collateral damage was unacceptable to the Mexicangovernment.The chaos in Culiacan, a bastion of the elder GuzmanSinaloa cartel, has turned up pressure on Lopez Obrador, whotook office in December promising to pacify a country weary ofmore than a decade of gang violence.Admitting that the cartel response was faster than whatauthorities expected, Ebrard said valuable lessons were learnedfrom the failed attempt to capture the Guzman son.Ebrard said Mexico armed forces need better training andtechnology, underscoring that there is still an ""outstandingarrest warrant for Ovidio Guzman and other people and thecorresponding authorities have to do what is necessary"" to carryout the arrests.(Reporting by Anthony Esposito in Mexico CityAdditional reporting by Lizbeth Diaz in Mexico CityEditing by Matthew Lewis and Alistair Bell)"

Honduran president hobbled after being implicated in brother's bribery conviction	"By Delphine Schrank(Reuters) - Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez emerged battered from the trial and conviction of his brother on Friday after the U.S. Justice Department concluded that the evidence showed narcotraffickers had bribed the president and his party. A U.S. jury on Friday found President Hernandez' brother, Juan Antonio ""Tony"" Hernandez, guilty of conspiring to import cocaine, illicit weapons possession and lying to U.S. authorities.U.S. prosecutors did not indict President Hernandez. But the Department of Justice reiterated in a statement after the verdict that as a candidate and then president, Hernandez received drug money for his electoral campaigns, including from Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.Hernandez, who took office in 2014, has repeatedly denied the allegations. Analysts say the verdict has undoubtedly weakened the president, who has faced intermittent street protests calling for his ouster since he was sworn in for a second term in January 2018 amid allegations of fraud.    The Central American leader may now reckon with dwindling support at home, where local press avidly covered the two-week trial.He also may be more reliant than ever on support from the U.S. government. Long praised as a key U.S. ally in the drug war, he has under President Donald Trump faced intense pressure to partner in the U.S. effort to curb migration flows. The U.S. State Department declined to comment.Witnesses at the trial alleged that President Hernandez pledged to protect his brother from extradition and called for bribing mayors in Copan, a department bordering Guatemala and a notorious gateway for cocaine trafficking, to secure power for himself and the ruling National Party.Hernandez says the allegations are the fabrications of criminals bent on revenge for his efforts against organized crime. ""I reaffirm that it is false that I have received or accepted money from these criminals ... I reiterate my total rejection on behalf of the Honduran people of the suggestion that our country is a narco state,"" he said in a speech on Thursday.    He also defended his anti-corruption legacy in the Thursday address and on Twitter after Friday guilty verdict.<p/>'VERY COMPLICATED'Luis Zelaya, president of the opposition Liberal Party, told reporters that the party would demand that Hernandez leave power to be replaced with a transitional government.""It is no longer a suspicion he is involved in drug trafficking,"" Zelaya said. ""He has to be accused."" Hernandez will likely face a rough next two years in office ""because his legitimacy is being increasingly questioned,"" said Kurt Ver Beek, co-founder of the Honduran-based civil society organization, the Association for a More Just Society. ""Probably in his favor is that the opposition is also very weak and divided,"" he said. He added that it helped that there was little physical evidence that Hernandez is guilty, however.""If in this trial they came out with clear evidence â for example audio or video or pictures of Juan Orlando taking money from drug traffickers - it probably would have meant the end of his administration,"" said Ver Beek.One former senior U.S. official with knowledge of Honduras had long credited Hernandez for his willingness to partner with the United States in fighting crime, but added that narrative might have to be reassessed.Hernandez often points out that under his administration, the country homicide rate was halved in five years, to 40 people out of 100,000 inhabitants, after peaking in 2012 as the world highest outside a war zone. The president cooperated in extraditions, purging a corrupt police force and bolstering prosecutors and even invited in a key Organization of American States-sponsored anti-corruption body, measures that helped hasten his younger brother trial.With Hernandez' standing even within his own party diminished, the Trump administration support is all the more crucial, the former U.S. official said.""Because without that I think he thinks and a lot of people in Honduras think it could be over for him,"" the official added.The Trump administration in June slashed aid that previous U.S. administrations had given to help curb the root causes of migration. On Wednesday, the Trump administration announced that some ""targeted assistance"" would resume after Honduras, along with El Salvador and Guatemala, struck migration deals with the United States.<p/> (Reporting by Delphine Schrank; Editing by Christian Plumb and Sonya Hepinstall)"
Brother of Honduran president found guilty in U.S. drug trial	"By Brendan PiersonNEW YORK (Reuters) - Honduran politician Juan Antonio ""Tony"" Hernandez was found guilty of U.S. drug trafficking charges on Friday after a two-week trial that featured dramatic accusations of corruption against his brother, the Central American nation president.The verdict against Hernandez, 41, on all counts was handed up by a jury in federal court in Manhattan. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 17 and faces up to life in prison.""They reached a verdict that was inconsistent with the truth,"" one of Hernandez lawyers, Omar Malone, told journalists outside the courthouse. ""We plan to appeal on behalf of Mr. Hernandez.""Members of Hernandez family who attended the trial were swarmed by protesters as they left the courthouse. Some protesters chanted ""Fuera JOH,"" meaning ""Out with JOH,"" referring to Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez.Tony Hernandez was arrested in Miami in 2018 and charged with drug trafficking and possessing illegal weapons. U.S. prosecutors accused him of helping smuggle almost 200,000 kilograms (220 tons) of cocaine into the United States while enjoying the protection of his brother. President Hernandez has repeatedly denied the allegation.In a Twitter post, he said that he received news of the verdict with ""great sadness."" The verdict was ""based on testimonies of confessed murderers,"" referring to former drug traffickers who cooperated with U.S. authorities in the trial.The two-week trial featured testimony from Honduran drug traffickers who are now in U.S. custody and cooperating with authorities, including, Amilcar Alexander Ardon, a former mayor, and Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, former leader of Honduras' Cachiros gang.Some of the most explosive testimony was from Ardon, who told jurors that Tony Hernandez promised Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman protection for his shipments in exchange for a $1 million donation to his brother presidential campaign in 2013.Rivera Maradiaga, who admitted to murdering 78 people,  testified that he paid bribes to multiple officials including Juan Orlando Hernandez.Tony Hernandez lawyers urged jurors not to trust the prosecutors' cooperating witnesses, describing them as career criminals willing to lie to get their prison sentences reduced.The president, who began his second term in January 2018 amid allegations of electoral fraud, has not been charged with a crime. He has represented himself as tough on narcotics and responsible for breaking up the six most powerful cartels in Honduras and extraditing 24 traffickers to the United States. He said traffickers were using his brother trial to seek revenge.Honduras is under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb migration to the United States.

RPT-UPDATE 7-'Failure:' Mexico admits bungled arrest of kingpin's son after mayhem	"(Repeats with no changes to the text or headline)By Dave Graham and Lizbeth DiazMEXICO CITY, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Mexican officials on Fridayadmitted they had bungled the arrest of kingpin Joaquin ""ElChapo"" Guzman son, who they let go during shootouts with druggangs in the streets of a major city, but the president insistedhis security strategy was working.Cartel gunmen surrounded around 35 police and nationalguards in the northwestern city of Culiacan on Thursday and madethem free Ovidio Guzman, one of the jailed drug lord dozen orso children, after his brief detention set off widespread gunbattles and a jailbreak that stunned the country.(For a graphic on Thursday events, please see: https://tmsnrt.rs/32sdppv)The chaos in Culiacan, a bastion of Guzman Sinaloa Cartel,turned up pressure on President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, whotook office in December promising to pacify a country weary ofmore than a decade of gang violence and murders.Security forces were attempting to enforce a federal judgearrest warrant against the younger Guzman for his extradition,drawing a fierce response, the government said.In the end, Lopez Obrador came under heavy criticism onsocial media and from security experts, who said thatauthorities risked encouraging copycat actions by caving in tothe gang, and that the retreat from a major city created theimpression that the cartel, not the state, was in control.His own officials said the operation in Culiacan, thecapital of Sinaloa state and home to nearly a million people,had not been planned as well as it should have been.""It was done hastily, the consequences were not considered,the riskiest part wasn't taken into account,"" Defense MinisterLuis Cresencio Sandoval told a news conference in Culiacan,alongside Security Minister Alfonso Durazo, who called theattempt to capture the Guzman son a ""failure.""Durazo admitted he and the military top brass were not awareahead of time of the mission to take into custody the allegedtrafficker, calling it a bureaucratic error.But the president defended the government response.""Capturing a criminal can't be worth more than peoplelives,"" he said, adding that officials ""did well"" to free OvidioGuzman. ""We don't want dead people, we don't want war,"" saidLopez Obrador, a veteran leftist who has advocated a lessconfrontational approach to tackling the gangs.""We're doing really well in our strategy,"" he said.The violent reaction to Guzman apprehension in a wealthyarea of Culiacan was on a scale rarely seen during Mexico longdrug wars.Sandoval said he had reports of at least eight peoplekilled, including five suspected gang members, in Culiacan,where schools were closed on Friday after the ordeal.More than 200 soldiers were being sent to reinforce the cityon Friday evening, a spokeswoman for the security ministry said.<p/>WHO'S IN CONTROL?One Facebook user stumbled on two dead bodies in the streetnear an abandoned truck, suggesting the death toll may yet risein the city, where the government said gunmen staged 14 attackson the armed forces and 19 road blocks where vehicles burned.Footage of Thursday chaos on social media showed panickedresidents fleeing and high caliber gunfire ringing out acrosstown. People cowered in shopping centers and supermarkets andblack plumes of smoke rose across the skyline.Chaos continued into the night after a large group ofinmates also escaped from the city prison.On Friday, cars navigated burnt out vehicles that partiallyblocked streets.Gladys McCormick, a security analyst at Syracuse Universityin the United States, said the latest news from Mexico read likethat of a country in ""the throes of war.""""What is incontrovertible is that the Sinaloa Cartel wonyesterday battle,"" she added. ""Not only did they get thegovernment to release Ovidio, they demonstrated to the citizensof Culiacan as well as the rest of Mexico who is in control.""Durazo said the government decision to free Guzman""involved absolutely no negotiation.""Still, questions about how the release was handled continuedcirculating after defense minister Sandoval said nine securitypersonnel were ""held and freed without injury.""Meanwhile, Jose Luis Gonzalez Meza, a lawyer for the Guzmanfamily, thanked Lopez Obrador for the government actions.""We have a humane president, a Christian president who inthe end decided not to hurt Ovidio,"" he told a news conference.<p/>BLAMING OTHERSLopez Obrador rejected the suggestion the government hadshowed weakness in releasing the younger Guzman, describing thisview as ""conjecture"" put about by his adversaries to hurt him.A trenchant critic of past administrations, Lopez Obradorsaid previous government strategies had turned Mexico into a""graveyard"" and that his critics wanted him to continue with it.He argues that authorities should focus more on the rootcauses of drug violence, such as poverty and a lack of jobs.To boost security, Lopez Obrador has created a new NationalGuard - but thousands of that militarized police force membershave instead been sent to contain illegal immigration throughMexico at the behest of U.S. President Donald Trump.He has also sought to underline his command of law and orderby chairing security cabinet meetings every weekday at 6 a.m.Still, the murder tally in Mexico this year is on track tosurpass last year record total of more than 29,000.Thursday events followed the massacre of more than a dozenpolice in western Mexico earlier this week, and the killing of14 suspected gangsters by the army a day later.Lopez Obrador said police swooped on the Culiacan house tocapture Ovidio Guzman, contradicting the initial version put outby the government, which was that officers had come under firefrom the building while passing, then found Guzman inside.The elder Guzman escaped from prison in Mexico twice, in2001 and 2015.

Factbox: Major incidents in Mexico's drug wars	"(Reuters) - Heavily armed fighters surrounded security forces in a Mexican city and made them free one of jailed drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman sons, after his capture triggered gunbattles and a prison break that sent civilians scurrying for cover.The incident surrounding the arrest of Ovidio Guzman was on a scale rarely seen in Mexico long drug wars and raised pressure on President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office last December promising to pacify the country. Here are some of the most significant moments in more than a decade of Mexico drug wars:<p/>* Sept 15, 2008 - Suspected members of the Zetas drug gang tossed grenades into a crowd celebrating Mexico independence day in the western city of Morelia, killing eight people and wounding more than 100.<p/>* Jan 31, 2010 - Suspected cartel assailants killed 13 high school students and two adults at a party in Ciudad Juarez, across from El Paso, Texas.<p/>* Aug 25, 2011 - Masked gunmen torch a casino in the northern city of Monterrey, killing 52 people, most of them women. Then President Felipe Calderon declared three days of mourning and demanded a crackdown on drugs in the United States, the main market for Mexican narcotics. <p/>* May 4, 2012 - The bodies of nine people were found hanging from a bridge and 14 others found dismembered in the border city of Nuevo Laredo.<p/>* Oct. 7, 2012 - Mexican Marines killed the leader of the Zetas drug gang, Heriberto ""The Executioner"" Lazcano, in the northern state of Coahuila. His body was snatched from the funeral home by armed men. <p/>* Sept. 26, 2014 - Forty-three student teachers disappeared after they were abducted in the state of Guerrero by police who the government said handed them over to a gang involved in heroin trafficking. Authorities definitively identified the remains of only one of them, and the incident has never been fully explained.<p/>* April 6, 2015 - Fifteen police were killed in an ambush in Jalisco state during weeks of violence that claimed the lives of more than two dozen officers and culminated in the shooting down of an army helicopter. Authorities blamed the violence on the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), formerly underlings in El Chapo Sinaloa Cartel who turned on their masters.     <p/>* July 11, 2015 - El Chapo, Mexico most notorious drug lord, broke out of a high-security prison for the second time, escaping in a tunnel built right under his cell. He had previously bribed his way out of prison during an escape in 2001.<p/>* Jan 8, 2016 - Security forces recaptured El Chapo in a pre-dawn shootout and chase through drains in his native Sinaloa.        <p/>* Sept 6, 2018 - Prosecutors said the bodies of at least 166 people had been found in the state of Veracruz, an important trafficking route for drug gangs moving narcotics toward the U.S. border.<p/>* Oct. 14, 2019 - Suspected CJNG hitmen shot dead more than a dozen police in an ambush in Michoacan, in one of the bloodiest attacks on security forces since President Lopez Obrador took office in late 2018.Â The next day, soldiers killed 14 suspected gang members in neighboring Guerrero.     <p/>(Graphic: Bungled arrest of kingpin son, click https://graphics.reuters.com/MEXICO-VIOLENCE/0100B2J91V6/index.html)<p/> (Compiled by Alistair Bell, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)"

Tuesday mass killing in Guerrero raised questions about whether the armed forces used excessive force, reviving the specter of past executions.Then came the bungled arrest on Thursday of the son of jailed kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman that turned the streets of Culiacan in Sinaloa into a scene of nightmarish urban warfare.Cartel gunmen surrounded security forces in the northwestern city and made them free Ovidio Guzman after his brief capture.<p/>WHAT'S THIS NEW SECURITY STRATEGY?Veteran leftist Lopez Obrador new strategy for battling crime focuses on addressing the root causes of violence, in particular reducing poverty, stamping out entrenched corruption, and giving young adults job opportunities.He has boosted wages along the U.S.-Mexico border, created thousands of apprenticeships, and is promoting investments in the impoverished south.He says he believes in the inherent good of all Mexicans, and says ""you can't fight fire with fire,"" and ""hugs not bullets.""

Tuesday masskilling in Guerrero raised questions about whether the armedforces used excessive force, reviving the specter of pastexecutions.Then came the bungled arrest on Thursday of the son ofjailed kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman that turned the streetsof Culiacan in Sinaloa into a scene of nightmarish urbanwarfare.Cartel gunmen surrounded security forces in the northwesterncity and made them free Ovidio Guzman after his briefcapture.<p/>WHAT'S THIS NEW SECURITY STRATEGY?Veteran leftist Lopez Obrador new strategy for battlingcrime focuses on addressing the root causes of violence, inparticular reducing poverty, stamping out entrenched corruption,and giving young adults job opportunities.He has boosted wages along the U.S.-Mexico border, createdthousands of apprenticeships, and is promoting investments inthe impoverished south.He says he believes in the inherent good of all Mexicans,and says ""you can't fight fire with fire,"" and ""hugs notbullets.""As well as his emphasis on combating the social ills thatspark violence, he has created a new National Guard force thatreplaces the federal police and has absorbed thousands ofsoldiers.<p/>IS IT WORKING?Not so far. Homicides in 2019 are on track to surpass lastyear record.Analysts warn the government has not clearly explained howit will use the National Guard to outsmart the cartels. With noclear short term strategy, there is a sense on the ground thatthis government is less tough on gangs, said Falko Ernst, Mexicoanalyst with the International Crisis Group, who has doneextensive fieldwork in crime-wracked states.""The inertia and lack of definition of a security strategyby the government has allowed regional armed conflicts to spinout of control,"" Ernst said. ""Criminal group members andcommanders have told me in Michoacan and in Guerrero that this(inertia) has meant a looser leash.""Additionally, many of the National Guard have been reroutedto deal with a wave of illegal migration through Mexico at thebehest of U.S. President Donald Trump.<p/>WHEN DID THIS START?Lopez Obrador regularly heaps blame on previous governmentsfor the delicate security situation in Mexico.Mexico 'War on Drugs' started in 2006 with formerPresident Felipe Calderon, who sent in armed forces to tacklethe increasingly powerful drug cartels, which had shifted gearsfrom smuggling cocaine for the Colombian cartels to becomingfull narcotrafficking operations themselves. Since then, morethan 200,000 people have been killed in gang-fueled violence andover 40,000 are missing.The crackdown led to the splintering of Mexico cartels andsome notable wins for the government, including the arrest of'El Chapo' Guzman. He escaped twice from jail in Mexico beforebeing extradited to the United States, where he was found guiltyin February of smuggling drugs and sentenced to life in prison.The U.S. government says that under Guzman leadership, theSinaloa cartel imported and distributed tons of cocaine,marijuana, methamphetamine and heroin in the United States overmore than two decades.<p/>DIDN'T JAILING EL CHAPO PUT AN END TO THE VIOLENCE?The extradition of Guzman was a double-edged sword.It ""appears to have led to violent competition from acompeting cartel, the CJNG,"" according to an August reportprepared by the U.S. Congressional Research Service. The CJNGhad split from Sinaloa in 2010 and is considered by manyanalysts to now be the most dangerous and largest Mexicancartel.Photos of Monday police ambush published on social mediashowed shot-up and burning police vehicles, as well as the slainofficers. They also showed large placards signed ""CJNG,"" left onpolice vehicles, which warned police not to support rival crimegroups, including Michoacan-based Los Viagras.And even after Guzman was locked away for life in a Coloradoprison known as ""the Alcatraz of the Rockies,"" the cartel hefounded has flourished.The Sinaloa cartel ""has fought brutally for increasedcontrol of routes through the border states of Chihuahua andBaja California, with the goal of remaining the dominant drugtrafficking organization,"" the Congressional Research Servicereport said.The cartel decentralized structure had allowed it toadapt, the report added.Within this decentralized structure, Ovidio Guzman, one of'El Chapo' Guzman at least 12 children, appears to have takenan active role. The U.S. Department of Justice unveiled anindictment against Ovidio and one of his brothers in February,charging them with conspiracy to distribute cocaine,methamphetamine, and marijuana in the United States.Security analyst Gladys McCormick at Syracuse University inthe United States said Thursday apparent capitulation to theSinaloa Cartel was ""sending a loud message to other organizedcrime networks... that if they show up with enough firepower toa fight, they will win and get their way because the governmentdoes not have the wherewithal to fight back.""(Reporting by Anthony Esposito, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)"

UPDATE 3-Cartel gunmen terrorize Mexican city, free El Chapo's son	"(Adds details of the violence in Culiacan)By Dave Graham and Lizbeth DiazMEXICO CITY, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Heavily armed fighterssurrounded security forces in a Mexican city on Thursday andmade them free one of drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzmansons, after his capture triggered gunbattles and a prison breakthat sent civilians scurrying for cover.Security Minister Alfonso Durazo said a patrol by NationalGuard militarized police first came under attack from within ahouse in the city of Culiacan, 1,235 km (770 miles) northwest ofMexico City.After entering the house, they found four men, includingOvidio Guzman, who is accused of drug trafficking in the UnitedStates.The patrol was quickly outmatched by cartel gunmen, however,and it was withdrawn to prevent lives being lost, the governmentsaid. Simultaneously, fighters swarmed through the city,battling police and soldiers in broad daylight. They torchedvehicles and left at least one gas station ablaze.""The decision was taken to retreat from the house, withoutGuzman, to try to avoid more violence in the area and preservethe lives of our personnel and recover calm in the city,"" Durazotold Reuters.The reaction to Guzman capture was on a scale rarely seenduring Mexico long drug war, even after his more famousfather arrests. The chaos was continuing as night fell.A large group of inmates escaped from the city prison.Residents cowered in shopping centers and supermarkets asgunfire roared. Black plumes of smoke rose across the skyline.Families with young children left their cars and lay flat inthe road. Bullets cracked up ahead. ""Dad, can we get up now?"" asmall boy said to his father in a video posted on Twitter.""No, stay there on the floor,"" the man replied, his voicetrembling.Cristobal Castaneda, head of security in Sinaloa, told theTelevisa network that two people had been killed and 21 injured,according to preliminary information.

Reuters TV showed scenes of at leastthree bodies lying next to cars on the street.<p/>WARNED OF REPRISALSThe chaos in Culiacan, long a stronghold for the Guzmans'Sinaloa cartel, will increase pressure on President AndresManuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December promising topacify a country weary after more than a decade of drug-warfighting. Murders this year are set to be at a record high.Thursday events follow the massacre of more than a dozenpolice in western Mexico earlier this week, and the killing of14 suspected gangsters by the army a day later.Falko Ernst, senior analyst for the International CrisisGroup in Mexico, said the release of Ovidio Guzman set ""adangerous precedent"" and sent a message that the state itself,including the army, could be blackmailed and was not in control.Presumed cartel members apparently intercepted a radiofrequency used by security forces, one video showed, warning ofreprisals against soldiers if Guzman was not freed.A state police spokesman confirmed to Reuters that severalprisoners escaped from a prison during the chaos. Video footageshowed a group of at least 20 prisoners running in the streets.It was not immediately clear how many had escaped.""They are freeing them,"" a panicked woman said in the videoapparently filmed from an tall building. ""No we can't gooutside!"" she said as other voices debated making a dash fortheir car.In another video, a man driving repeatedly shouted: ""Thereis a big gunfight,"" before taking a sharp turn and leaving hiscar at a gas station to take cover. His voice then becameinaudible because of the rattling roar of automatic gunfire.'El Chapo' Guzman led the Sinaloa cartel for decades,escaping from prison twice before being arrested and extraditedto the United States. He was found guilty in a U.S. court inFebruary of smuggling tons of drugs and sentenced to life inprison.He is believed to have about 12 children including Ovidio.The U.S. Department of Justice unveiled an indictment againstOvidio and another of the brothers in February, charging themwith conspiracy to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine, andmarijuana in the United States.The indictment gave Ovidio age as 28, and said he had beeninvolved in trafficking conspiracies since he was a teenager.Jose Luis Gonzalez Meza, a lawyer for the Guzmans, told newsnetwork Milenio that Ovidio had been in touch with the familyand said he was free.(Additional reporting by Stefanie Eschenbacher; Writing andadditional reporting by Frank Jack Daniel; Editing by RajuGopalakrishnan)"

Desperate African refugees pay to get into Libyan jails - UNHCR	"By Stephanie NebehayGENEVA, Oct 17 (Reuters) - African refugees in Libya are sodesperate that some are bribing their way into detention centresin the hope of eventually being resettled out of the war-torn,lawless country, the United Nations said on Thursday.Forces loyal to eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftarlaunched an offensive in April to try to wrest control ofTripoli from forces aligned with the internationally-recognisedgovernment, which is based in the capital.An air strike by opposition forces in July that killed morethan 50 people at Tajoura detention centre in Tripoli increasedpressure on countries to find a safe haven for trapped refugeesand migrants.But despite continuing shelling and air attacks - fightinghas killed more than 1,000 people and displaced 28,000 sinceApril - few countries have agreed to take refugees out of Libya,the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said.""So far 14 states have pledged 6,611 places ofresettlement...That all,"" Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR specialenvoy for the central Mediterranean situation, told a briefing.Canada, Norway and Italy are among them, while Niger andRwanda have offered others temporary sanctuary, he said.""There are many countries that could offer places ofresettlement and that do not,"" he added.Libya has become the main conduit for Africans fleeing warand poverty trying to reach Europe since former leader MuammarGaddafi was toppled in 2011, though the number of crossingsdropped sharply from 2017 amid a European Union-backed push toblock arrivals.Libya is host to 45,000 registered refugees andasylum-seekers, as well as an estimated 650,000 migrants, manyof whom have found jobs there, Cochetel said.More than 5,000 refugees and migrants are held in 19official detention facilities, some controlled by armed groups,as well as an unknown number in squalid centres run bytraffickers, he said. Rights groups say abuses are rifeincluding beating and forced labour.Detainees include those who left on boats for Europe andwere brought back by the Libyan Coast Guard, Cochetel said,underlining it is not a safe country of asylum.""And you have desperate individuals who go to detentioncentres, sometimes they pay to get inside detention centres.Sometimes they feel better protected in a detention centre thanoutside,"" Cochetel said.""Because some nationalities outside detention centres aretargeted by human traffickers, are kidnapped, and then you haveextortion, you have torture.""Some people donât feel safe in many urban centres in Libya.So some of them prefer to be detained, even if conditions arenot good in those detention centres.

Boston pension votes to fire money manager Fisher, withdrawals surge toward $1 billion	"By Tim McLaughlin and Ross KerberBOSTON (Reuters) - The City of Boston retirement board on Wednesday voted unanimously to end its relationship with money manager Kenneth Fisher, whose firm has lost almost $1 billion in assets after allegations he made disparaging remarks about women last week.In addition, on Wednesday evening an official of the Los Angeles pension system for police and firefighters said it will review the roughly $500 million it has invested with Fisher firm. ""As with other pension funds, we are very concerned with the inappropriate comments made by Mr. Fisher,"" said the Los Angeles system general manager, Ray Ciranna, via e-mail.     In Boston, Fisher Investments managed about $253 million for the city pensions. The retirement board vote came as Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said Fisher statements showed ""a profound lack of judgment.""""Boston will not invest in companies led by people who treat women like commodities. Reports of Ken Fisher comments and poor judgment are incredibly disturbing, and I have asked our retirement board to take a vote to end any relationship with Fisher Investments,"" Walsh said in a statement.So far, pension plans run for Boston, the state of Michigan and the city of Philadelphia have announced they will stop investing more than $900 million with Fisher Investments.In a video posted Oct. 9 on Twitter, Alex Chalekian, chief executive of a financial advisory firm, called attention to the comments Fisher made at a financial conference last week.Chalekian said Fisher made derogatory comments about genitalia, picking up girls and financier Jeffrey Epstein, among other topics. Epstein committed suicide in August while being held in jail awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.Fisher, who was not available for comment, has apologized for his remarks. Fisher Investments Chief Executive Damian Ornani has said the firm is launching a task force to address diversity and inclusion at the firm itself.Comments of public figures have come under increasing scrutiny in the era of social media and as the #MeToo movement, has exposed widespread sexual harassment or abuse of women in multiple spheres of American life and ended the careers of dozens of powerful men in media, politics, entertainment and business.Meanwhile, Boston-based mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments and pension plans around the country have said they are reviewing whether to keep investing money with Fisher Investments.Fisher controls an investment company that manages about $112 billion for individuals, mutual funds, trusts and pensions.

Two Belgian Islamic State militants escape camp in north Syria: Belgium	"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Two Islamic State militants from Belgium have escaped custody in northern Syria in the course of Turkey offensive against Kurdish forces there, the head of Belgium security assessment agency said on Wednesday.Paul Van Tigchelt, head of OCAD, told a parliamentary committee that two men and three women, either Belgian or with links to Belgium, were no longer in prison in a camp where they had been held under Kurdish control since the defeat of Islamic State (IS) by U.S.-backed coalition forces in 2017.Kurdish officials have said almost 800 IS-affiliated foreigners, many of them women and children, escaped Ain Issa camp in northwestern Syria after the Turkish incursion began last week. There are also fears that jihadists held in jails in Kurdish-controlled areas of northern Syria could escape.""It is unlikely that the FTFs could reach the European continent unnoticed and uncontrolled,"" Van Tigchelt said referring, using an acronym for ""foreign terrorist fighters"", of which there were about 55 in Syria with links to Belgium.""This is unlikely, but you should be clear that this is not impossible. And it is unlikely as long as - among other things - that the deal that Turkey struck with the EU holds.""The European Union and Turkey reached a deal in 2016 under which Turkey agreed to take back migrants, crack down on human traffickers and improve conditions for refugees in return for 6 billion euros ($6.6 billion) of aid and visa liberalization.Some EU countries are wary of doing anything to anger Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who last week warned that he would ""open the gates"" and send 3.6 million refugees to Europe if it did not back him in his Syria offensive.Diplomats and officials have told Reuters that European states are trying to fast-track a plan to move thousands of foreign IS militants out of Syrian prison camps and into Iraq given that the outbreak of fresh conflict in Syria raised the risk of jihadists escaping or returning home. ""An uncontrolled return is the biggest nightmare of the security services,"" Federal Prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw told the committee.The stated objective of Turkey incursion into northern Syria is to carve out a ""safe zone"" to resettle many of the 3.6 million Syrian war refugees it is hosting.

There are also fears that jihadists held in jails inKurdish-controlled areas of northern Syria could escape.""It is unlikely that the FTFs could reach the Europeancontinent unnoticed and uncontrolled,"" Van Tigchelt saidreferring, using an acronym for ""foreign terrorist fighters"", ofwhich there were about 55 in Syria with links to Belgium.""This is unlikely, but you should be clear that this is notimpossible. And it is unlikely as long as - among other things -that the deal that Turkey struck with the EU holds.""The European Union and Turkey reached a deal in 2016 underwhich Turkey agreed to take back migrants, crack down on humantraffickers and improve conditions for refugees in return for 6billion euros ($6.6 billion) of aid and visa liberalisation.Some EU countries are wary of doing anything to angerTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who last week warned that hewould ""open the gates"" and send 3.6 million refugees to Europeif it did not back him in his Syria offensive.Diplomats and officials have told Reuters that Europeanstates are trying to fast-track a plan to move thousands offoreign IS militants out of Syrian prison camps and into Iraqgiven that the outbreak of fresh conflict in Syria raised therisk of jihadists escaping or returning home. [nL5N26X0JC[""An uncontrolled return is the biggest nightmare of thesecurity services,"" Federal Prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw toldthe committee.The stated objective of Turkey incursion into northernSyria is to carve out a ""safe zone"" to resettle many of the 3.6million Syrian war refugees it is hosting.

Google, Reddit defend tech legal protections ahead of Congress hearing	"By David ShepardsonWASHINGTON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - A 23-year-old law givingtechnology companies legal protection from lawsuits overuser-generated content remains critical to the internetfuture, Alphabet Inc Google unit and social mediasite Reddit Inc said in testimony released on Tuesday.Senior executives from Google, Reddit, the ElectronicFrontier Foundation and legal experts are due to face questionson Wednesday in Congress about the 1996 Communications DecencyAct, which critics say shields tech companies from dealing withthreatening, violent, dangerous or bullying content.Lawmakers from both major political parties have saidCongress could make additional changes to the law to restrictcompanies' immunity. Last year, Congress made it easier forprosecutors and sex-trafficking victims to sue social medianetworks, advertisers and others that kept exploitative materialon their platforms.At issue is Section 230 of the act, which generally providesimmunity to online platforms for content posted by users,although companies can still be held liable for content thatviolates criminal or intellectual property law.Advocates say the law has helped the rapid growth ofinternet companies over the past 20 years and encouraged freeexpression.Katherine Oyama, Google global head of intellectualproperty policy, said Section 230 incentivizes ""action againstharmful content"" and Google has more than 10,000 people workingon content moderation.Without Section 230, search engines, video sharingplatforms, blogs and other providers would ""either not be ableto filter content at all (resulting in more offensive onlinecontent, including adult content, spam, security threats, etc.)or would over-filter content (including important cases ofpolitical speech),"" Oyama said in written testimony.The U.S. House Energy and Commerce committee releasedwritten testimonies ahead of Wednesday hearing, which istitled ""Fostering a Healthier Internet to Protect Consumers.""Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said Section 230 has incentivized""good faith attempts to mitigate the unavoidable downsides offree expression.""While these downsides are serious and demand the attentionof both us in industry and you in Congress, they do not outweighthe overwhelming good that 230 has enabled.""Huffman said that ""all-or-nothing moderation simply isnâtfeasible,"" given the fact Reddit handles more than 750,000 postsand 6.3 million comments per day across over 130,000 activecommunities.Danielle Keats Citron, a Boston University law professor,said courts had stretched Section 230 legal shield far beyondwhat it was intended for, and instead has been used ""to immunizeplatforms from liability even though they knew about usersâillegal activity, deliberately refused to remove it, and ensuredthat those responsible for the illegality could not beidentified.""In June, Republican Senator Josh Hawley introducedlegislation to remove immunity large tech companies receiveunder Section 230 unless they submit to an external audit thatproves their algorithms and content-removal practices arepolitically neutral.(Reporting by David Shepardson; editing by Jane Wardell)"

Italy's shadow economy grew 1.5% in 2017; government plans crackdown	ROME, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Italy shadow economy grew 1.5% in2017, the government estimated on Tuesday, bolstering its casefor the crackdown it plans in the 2020 budget.National statistics bureau ISTAT reported that theunderground economy, which comprises illegal activities andbusiness and labour hidden from the authorities, was worth 211billion euros  ($232.21 billion) in 2017, or 12.1% of grossdomestic product.Some 192 billion euros was undeclared business. Another 19billion came from illegal activities such as drug traffickingand some forms of prostitution.False earnings declarations in tax returns amounted to morethan 97 billion euros, ISTAT estimated, while undeclared orirregular jobs increased by 25,000 to 3.7 million.The government of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement andthe centre-left Democratic Party (PD) is preparing a raft ofmeasures in the budget to tackle tax evasion, encouraging theuse of easily traced credit cards rather than opaque cashtransactions.The draft budget is due to be approved by the cabinet lateron Tuesday, before being sent to the European Commission forscrutiny.According to government sources, the budget may introducesanctions for retailers and service providers that do not acceptcredit cards. It may also set a lower rate of value-added taxfor purchases made by card rather than cash.The government is also considering lowering to 1,000 eurosfrom 3,0000 euros the threshold above which it is illegal tomake transactions in cash.($1 = 0.9087 euros)(Reporting by Antonella Cinelli; editing by Gavin Jones, LarryKing)
RPT-SPECIAL REPORT-The hunt for Asia's El Chapo	(Repeats for clients in Asia.)By Tom AllardBANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - He is Asiaâs most-wanted man. Heis protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by privatejet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single nightat a Macau casino.Tse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspectedof leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicateformed out of an alliance of five of Asiaâs triad groups,according to law enforcement officials. Its members call itsimply âThe Company.â Police, in a nod to one of Tseâsnicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for âBrother NumberThree.âThe syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes ofmethamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozencountries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the SouthPacific. But meth â a highly addictive drug with devastatingphysical and mental effects on long-term users â is its mainbusiness, they say.In what it calls a conservative estimate, the United NationsOffice on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicateâsmeth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could beas high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that thecartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that hasexpanded at least fourfold in the past five years.This unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered anunprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is theprime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previouslyunreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by theAustralian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by farthe biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drugtrafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved inthe investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar,China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan,while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in theinvestigation.A document containing AFP profiles of the operationâs top 19syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as theleader of the syndicate. According to the document, theorganization has âbeen connected with or directly involved in atleast 13 casesâ of drug trafficking since January 2015. Thedocument does not provide specific details of the cases.A Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as theâMultinational CEOâ of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug EnforcementAdministration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regionalgovernment agencies says Tse is âbelieved to beâ the leader ofthe Sam Gor syndicate.Police have not publicly identified Tse as the suspectedboss of the trafficking group.Some investigators say that the scope of the syndicateâsoperation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with LatinAmericaâs most legendary narco-traffickers. âTse Chi Lop is inthe league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,â said JeremyDouglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC.âThe word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is nodoubt it applies here.âReuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response toquestions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwanâs Ministryof Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment oninvestigations.During the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacificto uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. Thisincluded interviews with more than two dozen law enforcementofficials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligencereports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filingsand other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders inMyanmarâs Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asiaâs GoldenTriangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producingdrugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visitedthe Thai compound of one of the syndicateâs alleged drug lords.What emerges is a portrait of an organization that is trulytransnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on theAFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police oftenrefer to as âT1â - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong,Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.The syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined andsophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any LatinAmerican cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor suppliesa bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with amore diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartelsdo, including Japanâs Yakuza, Australia biker gangs and ethnicChinese gangs across Southeast Asia.The crime network is also less prone to uncontrolledoutbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, policesay. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soakedrivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in aunited pursuit of gargantuan profits.âThe crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operatewith seamless efficiency,â says one veteran Western anti-drugsofficial. âThey function like a global corporation.âLike most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed,the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.In addition to the contrasts between their drug operations,thereâs another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lopand Joaquin âEl Chapoâ Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailedMexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocainetrafficker have been feted in song and on screen for theirextravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little hasbeen revealed about Tseâs life and career. Unlike the Latin druglords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.<p/>A TRIP, A TRAPTse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southernChina, and grew up during Chinaâs Cultural Revolution. Amid thebloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a groupof imprisoned members of Maoâs Red Guard in the southern city ofGuangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the BigCircle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police,and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to HongKong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for theircriminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.In the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong,Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator basedin Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smugglingring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawlessopium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand,China and Laos meet.In 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned ondrug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of NewYork. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin intoAmerica, the records show. A potential life sentence hung overhis head.Through a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse beggedfor leniency.His ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed.If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressedâgreat sorrowâ for his crime, court records show.The entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced tonine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctionalinstitution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.After he was freed in 2006, police say he returned toCanada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release forthe next four years. Itâs unclear when Tse returned to his oldhaunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wiferegistered a business, the China Peace Investment Group CompanyLtd, in Hong Kong in 2011.Police suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. Heâpicked up where he left off,â said the senior AFP investigator.Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau andthe Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that provedirresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of hisdrug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at noextra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.His policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good forbusiness, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011,AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin andmeth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, ratherthan arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them undersurveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closelyfor more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drugcell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. Theywanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.The syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their otherdrug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics andselling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of thesyndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of theMelbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong policewatched the Australian meet two men.One of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-partedhair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinesefamily man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillanceshowed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personalsecurity. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard ofThai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eightworked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated aspart of his security protocol.Tse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resortsand five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage inprivate jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailandfor a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt,according to a member of the task force investigating thesyndicate.Tse was a frequent visitor to Asiaâs casinos and fond ofbetting on horses, especially on English races. âWe believe helost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on thetables in Macau,â said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.As the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspectedthat the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australiawith meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA,commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of theSam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say,when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag ofwhite powder strapped to each of his thighs.<p/>âALADDINâS CAVE OF INTELâCai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through theairport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. Itwas the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous,picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, saida former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation.âHis hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,â thecommander told Reuters. âMethamphetamine is very toxic.âCai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighswas a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerfultranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. âWe were veryfortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,â thecommander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had beenmonitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport policehad no idea who he was.Cai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained aâpesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,â according toMyanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. Afriend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father.Caiâs flight was about to leave and there was no drug test forketamine at the airport, the commander said.Unimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight.The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport.One recognized him from surveillance work heâd been conducting.Still, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos theylater found on one of his phones might have explained hissilence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at leastthree assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorchand electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, saidone investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphysaying âLoyalty to the Heavens.â The banner was a âtriad-relatedsign,â he added.The tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewedthe video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boatbecause he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was alaw enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity ofthe victimâs claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triadmembers were sending a message about the price of disloyalty,the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.The torture videos were just one of the items allegedlyfound in Caiâs two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker wasa diligent chronicler of the drug syndicateâs activities, butsloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones,police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social mediaconversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.They were âan Aladdinâs Cave of intel,â said one AFPcommander based in North Asia.For at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedlytravelled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal forthe syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by theDrug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining itsinvestigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slipfrom an international courier company recording the delivery oftwo consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leafChinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, teapackets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, hadbeen cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.Two days after Caiâs arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangonaddress, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. Thatevening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangonjetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so,Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, butother than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate,including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.Then came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the galleryof photos and videos on Caiâs phones, an AFP investigator basedin Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefinghe had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier.âThis one stuck out because it was Canadian,â he recalled. âIsaid: âFuck, I know who you are!'âIt was Tse Chi Lop.The Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team ofintelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to workon Caiâs phones.Australia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crimegangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade,the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large andsmall, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agentdescribed the database, which includes a trove of names,chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata andsurveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligenceon Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.The AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Caiâsphones with the database. They discovered photos related tothree big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted inChina, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigatorsand Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chineseanti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers andaddresses in Caiâs phones to other meth busts in China.For regional counter-narcotics police, the revelationsupended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked bydifferent crime groups. It became clear the shipments were thework of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcoticsagent said they believed Cai was âone of the members of amega-syndicate,â which had been involved in multiple âdrugscases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.âCai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is stillin jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug traffickingcharges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable tocontact Caiâs lawyer.<p/>METH PARADISEDuring his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversingthe country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers andobtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to abigger vessel in international waters, according to police andthe Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained picturesof the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot wherethe meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.The police reconstruction of Caiâs dealings in Myanmar ledto another major revelation: The epicenter of meth productionhad shifted from Chinaâs southern provinces to Shan State inMyanmarâs northeastern borderlands. Operating in China hadprovided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursoringredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that weresmuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories inthe Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor thefreedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.Armed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like ShanState have long controlled large tracts of territory and useddrug revenues to finance their frequent battles with themilitary. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmargovernment with rebel groups over the years has brought relativecalm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities toflourish.âProduction facilities can be hidden from law enforcementand other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,âanalyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for theInternational Crisis Group. âDrug production and profits are nowso vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.âThe Myanmar government and police did not respond toquestions from Reuters.Along the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, thereis evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirtsa deep ravine known as the âValley of Death,â where ethnicKachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed fordecades with Myanmarâs army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder pasttrucks carrying building materials and workers.The Kaung Kha militiaâs immaculate and expansive newheadquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep greenhills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometersaway, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carvedout of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churnedout vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yabatablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine.When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized morethan 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kgof caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substancesused in drug production.The Loikan facility was âvery likelyâ to have been thesource of much of the Sam Gor syndicateâs meth, said theYangon-based AFP officer.âSome militia were involved in the lab,â said Oi Khun, acommunications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia,in an interview. He paused, then added: âBut not with theknowledge of senior membersâ of the militia.One person in Loikan described how workers from the labwould come down from the hills. The men, like most of thevillagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than thelocals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.âI asked them once. âWhy donât you bathe?ââ the person said.âThey said they did, but there was nothing they could do aboutthe smell.âThe rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into theskin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signaturestench might reveal their illicit activities. âWe all knew,â theperson said. âWe just didnât talk about it. That just brings youdanger.âMeth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals,say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime networkâscouriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across theAsia-Pacific.Shanâs super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in theworld, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official toldReuters. âThey can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on theground and let it dry.âThe UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for methis worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The businessmodel for meth is âvery differentâ to heroin, said the UNODCâsDouglas. âInputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is notneeded, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are thereforefar, far higher.âThe wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced innortheastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to aUNODC report citing the China National Narcotics ControlCommission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according tothe UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand,$298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For theJapanese market, thatâs more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.The money the syndicate is making âmeans that if they loseten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,âsaid the Chinese counter-narcotics official. âThey can affordfailure. It doesnât matter.â<p/>âMONEY, MONEYâThe analysis of Caiâs phones was continuing to provideleads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of thepick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden withMyanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being atsea for weeks.One of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called theShun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcementdocument reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at seawhen, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into amarine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth andpaid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MVValkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40sand hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about seasickness tablets. According to local media, he didnât have afishing license at the time.After buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista ona course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 inthe Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After therendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote WesternAustralian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew wasseen âunloading a lot of packagesâ into a van, the commandersaid.âWe knew we had an importation. We know the methodology oforganized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty andcomes back with some gear on it, that it hasnât just droppedfrom the sky in the middle of the ocean.âInvestigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and carhire records. The phones of some of the Australian drugtraffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say,that some of Smithâs alleged co-conspirators were members of anethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels andComanchero motorcycle gangs, known as âbikiesâ in Australia.As they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes ofcrystal meth into Australia, Smith associates met with Sam Gorsyndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copyof an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australiansreconvened in Perth a month later.Bikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties anda self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians hadrefined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-starhotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to policeinvestigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants,said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar &amp; Grill in Perth.The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu thatincluded caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.On November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again,this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into theAndaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the methfrom Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coastof the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to theIndian Ocean.The Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.When the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista ininternational waters off the West Australian coast on December19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting âmoney, money,âaccording to the commander and local media reports. The Shun DeManâs crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smithand his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers provedtheir identity by matching their portion to the fragment held bythe crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.The Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city ofGeraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. Themen unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members ofthe AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assaultweapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guiltyto importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some ofhis alleged associates are still on trial.Taiwanâs Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said ithad âworked together with our counterparts on the investigationâof the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the âsubstantialseizure of illicit narcoticsâ by the Australian authorities inDecember 2017. The bureau said it was âaware that Taiwanesesyndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in(the) Asia-Pacific region,â and was working âcollaboratively andclosely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates andcross-border drug trafficking.â<p/>NIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZEDAs the investigation into the syndicate deepened, policeconcluded that crime groups from across the region had undergonea kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include thethree biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. Theother two are the Big Circle Gang, Tseâs original triad, and theBamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator,the syndicateâs supply chain is so complex and expertly run thatit âmust rival Appleâs.ââThe syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast marketto tap,â said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police seniorcolonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade.âThe power this network possesses is unimaginable.âInvestigators have had wins. In February last year, policebusted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enoughtea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more thanone tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gorlieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar.In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspectedsyndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.Located near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringedcompound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was usedto experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house tothe back of the property.Sue wasnât there, but property and money from 38 bankaccounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seizedduring the investigation. Sue is still at large.But the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for thewider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystalmeth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East andSoutheast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell inmost countries. This pattern of falling prices and risingseizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019,âsuggested the supply of the drug had expanded.âIn the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusiveadversary. When authorities had success stopping the drugmotherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its productin shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the methcoming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, thesyndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. Thisincluded deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, eachcontaining about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand onnarrow jungle paths.Over the years, police have had little success in takingdown Asiaâs drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leadershave been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according tothe AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcoticskingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more thana short period was in the mid-1970s. Thatâs when Ng Sik-ho, awily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentencedto 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opiumand morphine, according to court records.So far, Tse has avoided Limpy Hoâs fate. He is beingtracked, and all the signs are he knows it, saycounter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say theybelieve he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.(Reporting by Tom Allard. Additional reporting by ReutersStaff. Editing by Peter Hirschberg.)
UPDATE 3-More than a dozen police killed in ambush in violent Mexican state	"(Adds details from official)MEXICO CITY, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Suspected cartel hitmen shotdead more than a dozen police in an ambush in the westernMexican state of Michoacan, authorities said on Monday, in oneof the bloodiest attacks on security forces since PresidentAndres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office.The ministry for public security said the attack was carriedout in the municipality of Aguililla in Michoacan, a state thathas long been convulsed by turf wars between drug gangs, notablythe Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and its enemies.The federal public security ministry said 14 police werekilled, though its Michoacan state counterpart reported that 13officers were confirmed dead and three injured.Photos of the crime scene published on social media showedshot-up and burning police vehicles, as well as the bodies ofslain officers. They also showed large placards signed by ""CJNG""left on police vehicles. They warned police not to support rivalcrime groups, including Los Viagras.The ambush was an attack on the police by local gangsters,said a state official, who requested anonymity. The officialconfirmed the authenticity of the photos.The Michoacan security ministry said on Twitter the statepolice were working near El Aguaje, north of the town ofAguililla, when they came under fire.Three police trucks were ambushed and there was noindication that the suspected gang members had sufferedcasualties, the state official said.Michoacan has for several years been a stronghold of theCJNG, which in 2015 was blamed for a series of attacks on policein the neighboring state of Jalisco as it sought to consolidateits control over drug trafficking in the region.El Aguaje is a few miles from the state border with Jalisco.The heavily armed CJNG has used intimidation and bribery toexercise considerable control over local law enforcement,officials say. Police salaries are often no match for the gangfinancial muscle, which in large part has been built ontrafficking crystal meth.Fifteen police were killed in a single ambush in Jalisco in2015 during six weeks of violence that claimed the lives of morethan two dozen officers and culminated in the shooting down ofan army helicopter on May 1, 2015.More than 29,000 murders, a record for the country, wereregistered in Mexico last year, and Lopez Obrador took officepledging to restore peace and order. But he has struggled, andthe 2019 murder tally is at risk of topping last year total.(Reporting by Miguel Gutierrez and Dave Graham in Mexico CityEditing by Matthew Lewis and Lisa Shumaker)"
Exclusive: Police chase suspected kingpin of vast Asian meth syndicate	By Tom AllardBANGKOK (Reuters) - The largest ever task force assembled to fight organized crime in Asia has identified a long-time drug trafficker, a China-born Canadian national, as the suspected kingpin of a crime syndicate that police say dominates the $70 billion-a-year Asia-Pacific drug trade.The suspected syndicate leader is Tse Chi Lop, 55, an ex-convict who formerly lived in Toronto and has moved between Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan in recent years, according to counter-narcotics officers from four countries as well as law enforcement documents reviewed by Reuters. Authorities have not publicly identified Tse as the boss of the drug trafficking group.The syndicate he is suspected of running is known to its members as âThe Company.â Law enforcers also refer to it as âSam Gor,â or Brother Number Three in Cantonese, after one of Tseâs nicknames.The Australian Federal Police (AFP), which has taken the lead in the sprawling investigation, has compiled a list of top syndicate members that identifies Tse as âthe senior leader of the Sam Gor syndicate.â The group, the list says, has âbeen connected with or directly involved in at least 13 casesâ of drug trafficking since January 2015. The list, reviewed by Reuters, does not provide specific details of the cases.A flow-chart of the syndicate in a Taiwanese law enforcement document identifies Tse as the âMultinational CEOâ of the Sam Gor syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) alert circulated among regional government agencies this year says Tse is âbelieved to beâ the leader of the syndicate.âBrother Number Three is target number one,â said one AFP officer.Reuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwanâs Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on investigations.According to interviews with regional law enforcers from eight countries, as well as a review of law enforcement documents, the syndicate produces vast quantities of high-grade methamphetamine in Myanmar and trafficks the drug to countries stretching from Japan to New Zealand. The group is âconservativelyâ raking in $8 billion a year and could be earning as much as $17.7 billion annually, according to an estimate by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).âTse Chi Lop is in the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,â said Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC, referring to Latin Americaâs most legendary narco-traffickers. âThe word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no doubt it applies here.âThe syndicate is the major factor in the fourfold increase in region-wide meth trafficking in the past five years, the UNODC says. The supply of the highly addictive drug has surged, causing the street price to plummet in many countries. In a report in July, the UN agency said the meth trade had reached âunprecedented and dangerous levels,â and was a âdirect challenge to the public security and health of the region.â<p/>TRIAD ALLIANCEThe AFP has identified 19 top syndicate leaders, four of whom are Canadian nationals, the target list shows. Other suspected leaders hail from Hong Kong, Macau, mainland China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar and Vietnam. Some have links to drug trafficking that go back decades, according to the target list and investigators from four countries, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Tse has not been arrested. Counter-narcotics agents said they suspect he has long been aware he is under surveillance. So far, at least one senior member of the syndicate has been arrested, according to investigators and police documents.Tse has previously been involved in drug trafficking. In the late 1990s, he was arrested and extradited from Hong Kong to the United States on charges of conspiracy to import heroin into America. He was tried in New York and in 2000 sentenced to nine years in prison, which he mostly served in the federal correctional institution in Elkton, Ohio.The investigation, which involves about a dozen countries, has been dubbed Operation Kungur. Counter-narcotics agencies from China, Myanmar, the United States and Thailand are also leading participants, along with Australia. Taiwan, while not a formal member, is also assisting.At the core of the syndicate are at least five triad groups that originated in Hong Kong, Macau, China and Taiwan but which have global reach, AFP officers said. These are the 14K, Wo Shing Wo, Sun Yee On, the Big Circle Gang and the Bamboo Union.To get its drugs to market, the Sam Gor syndicate works closely with Japanâs Yakuza, Thai organized crime, and Australian motorcycle gangs, among other crime groups, according to regional anti-narcotics agents and documents reviewed by Reuters.According to regional police sources, the task force has gathered phone intercepts of Tse talking about his drug business, phone call logs linking him to other suspected syndicate members and surveillance footage of Tse with members of the crime group. Reuters has been briefed on this evidence but has not seen it.The UNODC estimates that the Asia-Pacific methamphetamine trade alone was worth as much as $61.4 billion in 2018, up from an estimated $15 billion just five years earlier. Heroin trafficking was worth up to $10.3 billion in 2018, it said.The syndicate is suspected to be the major player in both the meth and heroin markets, producing the drugs as well as the hallucinogen ketamine in super-labs in Myanmarâs northeast, where ethnic armed groups control swathes of territory. Police also say the syndicate traffics MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy, and cocaine sourced from Europe and Latin America respectively.The Myanmar government and police did not respond to questions from Reuters.Authorities say the drugs are distributed via repurposed fishing vessels that traverse vast distances, hidden in containers aboard other vessels, or transported by vehicles and couriers with backpacks who walk along jungle tracks leading out of the syndicateâs production hub in the heart of Southeast Asiaâs Golden Triangle.The full special report, The Hunt for Asiaâs El Chapo, can be read here and here: https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meth-syndicate<p/><p/><p/> (Reporting by Tom Allard.

Special Report: The hunt for Asia's El Chapo	By Tom AllardBANGKOK (Reuters) - He is Asiaâs most-wanted man. He is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private jet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night at a Macau casino.Tse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected of leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate formed out of an alliance of five of Asiaâs triad groups, according to law enforcement officials. Its members call it simply âThe Company.â Police, in a nod to one of Tseâs nicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for âBrother Number Three.âThe syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen countries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South Pacific. But meth â a highly addictive drug with devastating physical and mental effects on long-term users â is its main business, they say.In what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicateâs meth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be as high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a 40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has expanded at least fourfold in the past five years.This unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an unprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the prime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously unreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the Australian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about 20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far the biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug trafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in the investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar, China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan, while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the investigation.A document containing AFP profiles of the operationâs top 19 syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the leader of the syndicate. According to the document, the organization has âbeen connected with or directly involved in at least 13 casesâ of drug trafficking since January 2015. The document does not provide specific details of the cases.A Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the âMultinational CEOâ of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional government agencies says Tse is âbelieved to beâ the leader of the Sam Gor syndicate.Police have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected boss of the trafficking group.Some investigators say that the scope of the syndicateâs operation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin Americaâs most legendary narco-traffickers. âTse Chi Lop is in the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,â said Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC. âThe word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no doubt it applies here.âReuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwanâs Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on investigations.During the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific to uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This included interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement officials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence reports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings and other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in Myanmarâs Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asiaâs Golden Triangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing drugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited the Thai compound of one of the syndicateâs alleged drug lords.What emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly transnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the AFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often refer to as âT1â - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.The syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and sophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin American cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a more diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels do, including Japanâs Yakuza, Australia biker gangs and ethnic Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia.The crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled outbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police say. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked rivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a united pursuit of gargantuan profits.âThe crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate with seamless efficiency,â says one veteran Western anti-drugs official. âThey function like a global corporation.âLike most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed, the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.In addition to the contrasts between their drug operations, thereâs another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop and Joaquin âEl Chapoâ Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed Mexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine trafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their extravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has been revealed about Tseâs life and career. Unlike the Latin drug lords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.<p/>A TRIP, A TRAPTse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern China, and grew up during Chinaâs Cultural Revolution. Amid the bloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group of imprisoned members of Maoâs Red Guard in the southern city of Guangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big Circle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police, and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong Kong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their criminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.In the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong, Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based in Asia. He rose to become aÂ mid-ranking member of a smuggling ring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless opium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand, China and Laos meet.In 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on drug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New York. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into America, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over his head.Through a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged for leniency.His ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His 12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed. If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed âgreat sorrowâ for his crime, court records show.The entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to nine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional institution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.After he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to Canada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for the next four years. Itâs unclear when Tse returned to his old haunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife registered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company Ltd, in Hong Kong in 2011.Police suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He âpicked up where he left off,â said the senior AFP investigator. Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and the Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved irresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his drug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no extra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.His policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for business, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011, AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and meth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather than arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under surveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely for more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug cell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They wanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.The syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other drug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and selling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the syndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the Melbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police watched the Australian meet two men.One of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted hair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese family man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance showed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal security. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators.Â Up to eight worked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as part of his security protocol.Tse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts and five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in private jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand for a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt, according to a member of the task force investigating the syndicate.Tse was a frequent visitor to Asiaâs casinos and fond of betting on horses, especially on English races. âWe believe he lost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the tables in Macau,â said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.As the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected that the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia with meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the Sam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say, when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of white powder strapped to each of his thighs.<p/>âALADDINâS CAVE OF INTELâCai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the airport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It was the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous, picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said a former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation. âHis hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,â the commander told Reuters. âMethamphetamine is very toxic.âCai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs was a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful tranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. âWe were very fortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,â the commander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been monitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police had no idea who he was.Cai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a âpesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,â according to Myanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A friend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father. Caiâs flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for ketamine at the airport, the commander said.Unimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight. The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport. One recognized him from surveillance work heâd been conducting.Still, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they later found on one of his phones might have explained his silence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least three assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch and electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said one investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy saying âLoyalty to the Heavens.â The banner was a âtriad-related sign,â he added.The tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed the video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat because he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a law enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of the victimâs claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad members were sending a message about the price of disloyalty, the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.The torture videos were just one of the items allegedly found in Caiâs two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was a diligent chronicler of the drug syndicateâs activities, but sloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones, police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media conversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.They were âan Aladdinâs Cave of intel,â said one AFP commander based in North Asia.For at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly traveled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for the syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the Drug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its investigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip from an international courier company recording the delivery of two consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf Chinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea packets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had been cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.Two days after Caiâs arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon address, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That evening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon jetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so, Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but other than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate, including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.Then came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery of photos and videos on Caiâs phones,Â an AFP investigator based in Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing he had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier. âThis one stuck out because it was Canadian,â he recalled. âI said: âFuck, I know who you are!'âIt was Tse Chi Lop.The Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of intelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work on Caiâs phones.Australia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime gangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade, the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and small, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent described the database, which includes a trove of names, chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and surveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence on Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.The AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Caiâs phones with the database. They discovered photos related to three big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in China, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators and Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese anti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and addresses in Caiâs phones to other meth busts in China.For regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations upended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by different crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the work of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics agent said they believed Cai was âone of the members of a mega-syndicate,â which had been involved in multiple âdrugs cases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.âCai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still in jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking charges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to contact Caiâs lawyer.<p/>METH PARADISEDuring his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing the country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and obtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a bigger vessel in international waters, according to police and the Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures of the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where the meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.The police reconstruction of Caiâs dealings in Myanmar led to another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production had shifted from Chinaâs southern provinces to Shan State in Myanmarâs northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had provided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor ingredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were smuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the freedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.Armed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan State have long controlled large tracts of territory and used drug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the military. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar government with rebel groups over the years has brought relative calm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to flourish.âProduction facilities can be hidden from law enforcement and other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,â analyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the International Crisis Group. âDrug production and profits are now so vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.âThe Myanmar government and police did not respond to questions from Reuters.Along the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there is evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts a deep ravine known as the âValley of Death,â where ethnic Kachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for decades with Myanmarâs army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past trucks carrying building materials and workers.The Kaung Kha militiaâs immaculate and expansive new headquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green hills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers away, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved out of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned out vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba tablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine. When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more than 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg of caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances used in drug production.The Loikan facility was âvery likelyâ to have been the source of much of the Sam Gor syndicateâs meth, said the Yangon-based AFP officer.âSome militia were involved in the lab,â said Oi Khun, a communications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia, in an interview. He paused, then added: âBut not with the knowledge of senior membersâ of the militia.One person in Loikan described how workers from the lab would come down from the hills. The men, like most of the villagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the locals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.âI asked them once. âWhy donât you bathe?ââ the person said. âThey said they did, but there was nothing they could do about the smell.âThe rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the skin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature stench might reveal their illicit activities. âWe all knew,â the person said. âWe just didnât talk about it. That just brings you danger.âMeth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals, say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime networkâs couriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the Asia-Pacific.Shanâs super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the world, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told Reuters. âThey can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the ground and let it dry.âThe UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth is worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business model for meth is âvery differentâ to heroin, said the UNODCâs Douglas. âInputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not needed, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore far, far higher.âThe wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in northeastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a UNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control Commission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to the UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand, $298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the Japanese market, thatâs more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.The money the syndicate is making âmeans that if they lose ten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,â said the Chinese counter-narcotics official. âThey can afford failure. It doesnât matter.â<p/>âMONEY, MONEYâThe analysis of Caiâs phones was continuing to provide leads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the pick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with Myanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at sea for weeks.One of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the Shun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement document reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea when, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a marine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and paid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV Valkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s and hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea sickness tablets. According to local media, he didnât have a fishing license at the time.After buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on a course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in the Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the rendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western Australian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was seen âunloading a lot of packagesâ into a van, the commander said.âWe knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of organized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and comes back with some gear on it, that it hasnât just dropped from the sky in the middle of the ocean.âInvestigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car hire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug traffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say, that some of Smithâs alleged co-conspirators were members of an ethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and Comanchero motorcycle gangs, known as âbikiesâ in Australia.As they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of crystal meth into Australia, Smith associates met with Sam Gor syndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy of an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians reconvened in Perth a month later.Bikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and a self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had refined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star hotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police investigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants, said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar &amp; Grill in Perth. The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that included caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.On November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again, this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the Andaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth from Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the Indian Ocean.The Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.When the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in international waters off the West Australian coast on December 19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting âmoney, money,â according to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De Manâs crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith and his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved their identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by the crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.The Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of Geraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The men unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of the AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault weapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of his alleged associates are still on trial.Taiwanâs Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it had âworked together with our counterparts on the investigationâ of the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the âsubstantial seizure of illicit narcoticsâ by the Australian authorities in December 2017. The bureau said it was âaware that Taiwanese syndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in (the) Asia-Pacific region,â and was working âcollaboratively and closely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and cross-border drug trafficking.â<p/>NIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZEDAs the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police concluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone a kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the three biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the 1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The other two are the Big Circle Gang, Tseâs original triad, and the Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator, the syndicateâs supply chain is so complex and expertly run that it âmust rival Appleâs.ââThe syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market to tap,â said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior colonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade. âThe power this network possesses is unimaginable.âInvestigators have had wins. In February last year, police busted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough tea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66 was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than one tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor lieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar. In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected syndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.Located near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed compound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used to experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a 100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to the back of the property.Sue wasnât there, but property and money from 38 bank accounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized during the investigation. Sue is still at large.But the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the wider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal meth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and Southeast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in most countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising seizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019, âsuggested the supply of the drug had expanded.âIn the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive adversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug motherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product in shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth coming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the syndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This included deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each containing about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on narrow jungle paths.Over the years, police have had little success in taking down Asiaâs drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders have been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to the AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics kingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than a short period was in the mid-1970s. Thatâs when Ng Sik-ho, a wily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium and morphine, according to court records.So far, Tse has avoided Limpy Hoâs fate. He is being tracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say counter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they believe he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.<p/><p/><p/> (Reporting by Tom Allard. Additional reporting by Reuters Staff.

SPECIAL REPORT-The hunt for Asia's El Chapo	(For more Reuters Special Reports, click on)By Tom AllardBANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - He is Asiaâs most-wanted man. Heis protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by privatejet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single nightat a Macau casino.Tse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspectedof leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicateformed out of an alliance of five of Asiaâs triad groups,according to law enforcement officials. Its members call itsimply âThe Company.â Police, in a nod to one of Tseâsnicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for âBrother NumberThree.âThe syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes ofmethamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozencountries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the SouthPacific. But meth â a highly addictive drug with devastatingphysical and mental effects on long-term users â is its mainbusiness, they say.In what it calls a conservative estimate, the United NationsOffice on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicateâsmeth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could beas high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that thecartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that hasexpanded at least fourfold in the past five years.This unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered anunprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is theprime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previouslyunreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by theAustralian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by farthe biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drugtrafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved inthe investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar,China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan,while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in theinvestigation.A document containing AFP profiles of the operationâs top 19syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as theleader of the syndicate. According to the document, theorganization has âbeen connected with or directly involved in atleast 13 casesâ of drug trafficking since January 2015. Thedocument does not provide specific details of the cases.A Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as theâMultinational CEOâ of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug EnforcementAdministration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regionalgovernment agencies says Tse is âbelieved to beâ the leader ofthe Sam Gor syndicate.Police have not publicly identified Tse as the suspectedboss of the trafficking group.Some investigators say that the scope of the syndicateâsoperation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with LatinAmericaâs most legendary narco-traffickers. âTse Chi Lop is inthe league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,â said JeremyDouglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC.âThe word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is nodoubt it applies here.âReuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response toquestions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwanâs Ministryof Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment oninvestigations.During the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacificto uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. Thisincluded interviews with more than two dozen law enforcementofficials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligencereports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filingsand other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders inMyanmarâs Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asiaâs GoldenTriangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producingdrugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visitedthe Thai compound of one of the syndicateâs alleged drug lords.What emerges is a portrait of an organization that is trulytransnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on theAFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police oftenrefer to as âT1â - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong,Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.The syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined andsophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any LatinAmerican cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor suppliesa bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with amore diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartelsdo, including Japanâs Yakuza, Australia biker gangs and ethnicChinese gangs across Southeast Asia.The crime network is also less prone to uncontrolledoutbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, policesay. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soakedrivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in aunited pursuit of gargantuan profits.âThe crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operatewith seamless efficiency,â says one veteran Western anti-drugsofficial. âThey function like a global corporation.âLike most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed,the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.In addition to the contrasts between their drug operations,thereâs another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lopand Joaquin âEl Chapoâ Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailedMexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocainetrafficker have been feted in song and on screen for theirextravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little hasbeen revealed about Tseâs life and career. Unlike the Latin druglords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.<p/>A TRIP, A TRAPTse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southernChina, and grew up during Chinaâs Cultural Revolution. Amid thebloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a groupof imprisoned members of Maoâs Red Guard in the southern city ofGuangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the BigCircle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police,and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to HongKong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for theircriminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.In the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong,Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator basedin Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smugglingring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawlessopium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand,China and Laos meet.In 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned ondrug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of NewYork. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin intoAmerica, the records show. A potential life sentence hung overhis head.Through a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse beggedfor leniency.His ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed.If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressedâgreat sorrowâ for his crime, court records show.The entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced tonine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctionalinstitution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.After he was freed in 2006, police say he returned toCanada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release forthe next four years. Itâs unclear when Tse returned to his oldhaunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wiferegistered a business, the China Peace Investment Group CompanyLtd, in Hong Kong in 2011.Police suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. Heâpicked up where he left off,â said the senior AFP investigator.Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau andthe Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that provedirresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of hisdrug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at noextra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.His policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good forbusiness, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011,AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin andmeth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, ratherthan arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them undersurveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closelyfor more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drugcell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. Theywanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.The syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their otherdrug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics andselling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of thesyndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of theMelbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong policewatched the Australian meet two men.One of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-partedhair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinesefamily man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillanceshowed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personalsecurity. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard ofThai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eightworked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated aspart of his security protocol.Tse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resortsand five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage inprivate jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailandfor a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt,according to a member of the task force investigating thesyndicate.Tse was a frequent visitor to Asiaâs casinos and fond ofbetting on horses, especially on English races. âWe believe helost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on thetables in Macau,â said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.As the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspectedthat the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australiawith meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA,commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of theSam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say,when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag ofwhite powder strapped to each of his thighs.<p/>âALADDINâS CAVE OF INTELâCai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through theairport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. Itwas the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous,picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, saida former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation.âHis hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,â thecommander told Reuters. âMethamphetamine is very toxic.âCai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighswas a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerfultranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. âWe were veryfortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,â thecommander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had beenmonitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport policehad no idea who he was.Cai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained aâpesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,â according toMyanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. Afriend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father.Caiâs flight was about to leave and there was no drug test forketamine at the airport, the commander said.Unimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight.The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport.One recognized him from surveillance work heâd been conducting.Still, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos theylater found on one of his phones might have explained hissilence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at leastthree assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorchand electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, saidone investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphysaying âLoyalty to the Heavens.â The banner was a âtriad-relatedsign,â he added.The tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewedthe video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boatbecause he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was alaw enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity ofthe victimâs claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triadmembers were sending a message about the price of disloyalty,the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.The torture videos were just one of the items allegedlyfound in Caiâs two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker wasa diligent chronicler of the drug syndicateâs activities, butsloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones,police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social mediaconversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.They were âan Aladdinâs Cave of intel,â said one AFPcommander based in North Asia.For at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedlytravelled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal forthe syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by theDrug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining itsinvestigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slipfrom an international courier company recording the delivery oftwo consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leafChinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, teapackets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, hadbeen cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.Two days after Caiâs arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangonaddress, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. Thatevening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangonjetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so,Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, butother than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate,including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.Then came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the galleryof photos and videos on Caiâs phones, an AFP investigator basedin Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefinghe had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier.âThis one stuck out because it was Canadian,â he recalled. âIsaid: âFuck, I know who you are!'âIt was Tse Chi Lop.The Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team ofintelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to workon Caiâs phones.Australia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crimegangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade,the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large andsmall, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agentdescribed the database, which includes a trove of names,chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata andsurveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligenceon Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.The AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Caiâsphones with the database. They discovered photos related tothree big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted inChina, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigatorsand Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chineseanti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers andaddresses in Caiâs phones to other meth busts in China.For regional counter-narcotics police, the revelationsupended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked bydifferent crime groups. It became clear the shipments were thework of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcoticsagent said they believed Cai was âone of the members of amega-syndicate,â which had been involved in multiple âdrugscases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.âCai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is stillin jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug traffickingcharges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable tocontact Caiâs lawyer.<p/>METH PARADISEDuring his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversingthe country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers andobtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to abigger vessel in international waters, according to police andthe Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained picturesof the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot wherethe meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.The police reconstruction of Caiâs dealings in Myanmar ledto another major revelation: The epicenter of meth productionhad shifted from Chinaâs southern provinces to Shan State inMyanmarâs northeastern borderlands. Operating in China hadprovided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursoringredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that weresmuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories inthe Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor thefreedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.Armed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like ShanState have long controlled large tracts of territory and useddrug revenues to finance their frequent battles with themilitary. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmargovernment with rebel groups over the years has brought relativecalm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities toflourish.âProduction facilities can be hidden from law enforcementand other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,âanalyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for theInternational Crisis Group. âDrug production and profits are nowso vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.âThe Myanmar government and police did not respond toquestions from Reuters.Along the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, thereis evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirtsa deep ravine known as the âValley of Death,â where ethnicKachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed fordecades with Myanmarâs army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder pasttrucks carrying building materials and workers.The Kaung Kha militiaâs immaculate and expansive newheadquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep greenhills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometersaway, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carvedout of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churnedout vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yabatablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine.When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized morethan 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kgof caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substancesused in drug production.The Loikan facility was âvery likelyâ to have been thesource of much of the Sam Gor syndicateâs meth, said theYangon-based AFP officer.âSome militia were involved in the lab,â said Oi Khun, acommunications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia,in an interview. He paused, then added: âBut not with theknowledge of senior membersâ of the militia.One person in Loikan described how workers from the labwould come down from the hills. The men, like most of thevillagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than thelocals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.âI asked them once. âWhy donât you bathe?ââ the person said.âThey said they did, but there was nothing they could do aboutthe smell.âThe rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into theskin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signaturestench might reveal their illicit activities. âWe all knew,â theperson said. âWe just didnât talk about it. That just brings youdanger.âMeth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals,say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime networkâscouriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across theAsia-Pacific.Shanâs super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in theworld, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official toldReuters. âThey can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on theground and let it dry.âThe UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for methis worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The businessmodel for meth is âvery differentâ to heroin, said the UNODCâsDouglas. âInputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is notneeded, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are thereforefar, far higher.âThe wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced innortheastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to aUNODC report citing the China National Narcotics ControlCommission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according tothe UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand,$298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For theJapanese market, thatâs more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.The money the syndicate is making âmeans that if they loseten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,âsaid the Chinese counter-narcotics official. âThey can affordfailure. It doesnât matter.â<p/>âMONEY, MONEYâThe analysis of Caiâs phones was continuing to provideleads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of thepick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden withMyanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being atsea for weeks.One of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called theShun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcementdocument reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at seawhen, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into amarine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth andpaid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MVValkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40sand hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about seasickness tablets. According to local media, he didnât have afishing license at the time.After buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista ona course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 inthe Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After therendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote WesternAustralian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew wasseen âunloading a lot of packagesâ into a van, the commandersaid.âWe knew we had an importation. We know the methodology oforganized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty andcomes back with some gear on it, that it hasnât just droppedfrom the sky in the middle of the ocean.âInvestigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and carhire records. The phones of some of the Australian drugtraffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say,that some of Smithâs alleged co-conspirators were members of anethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels andComanchero motorcycle gangs, known as âbikiesâ in Australia.As they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes ofcrystal meth into Australia, Smith associates met with Sam Gorsyndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copyof an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australiansreconvened in Perth a month later.Bikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties anda self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians hadrefined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-starhotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to policeinvestigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants,said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar &amp; Grill in Perth.The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu thatincluded caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.On November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again,this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into theAndaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the methfrom Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coastof the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to theIndian Ocean.The Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.When the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista ininternational waters off the West Australian coast on December19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting âmoney, money,âaccording to the commander and local media reports. The Shun DeManâs crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smithand his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers provedtheir identity by matching their portion to the fragment held bythe crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.The Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city ofGeraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. Themen unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members ofthe AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assaultweapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guiltyto importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some ofhis alleged associates are still on trial.Taiwanâs Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said ithad âworked together with our counterparts on the investigationâof the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the âsubstantialseizure of illicit narcoticsâ by the Australian authorities inDecember 2017. The bureau said it was âaware that Taiwanesesyndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in(the) Asia-Pacific region,â and was working âcollaboratively andclosely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates andcross-border drug trafficking.â<p/>NIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZEDAs the investigation into the syndicate deepened, policeconcluded that crime groups from across the region had undergonea kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include thethree biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. Theother two are the Big Circle Gang, Tseâs original triad, and theBamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator,the syndicateâs supply chain is so complex and expertly run thatit âmust rival Appleâs.ââThe syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast marketto tap,â said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police seniorcolonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade.âThe power this network possesses is unimaginable.âInvestigators have had wins. In February last year, policebusted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enoughtea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more thanone tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gorlieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar.In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspectedsyndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.Located near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringedcompound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was usedto experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house tothe back of the property.Sue wasnât there, but property and money from 38 bankaccounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seizedduring the investigation. Sue is still at large.But the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for thewider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystalmeth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East andSoutheast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell inmost countries. This pattern of falling prices and risingseizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019,âsuggested the supply of the drug had expanded.âIn the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusiveadversary. When authorities had success stopping the drugmotherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its productin shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the methcoming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, thesyndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. Thisincluded deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, eachcontaining about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand onnarrow jungle paths.Over the years, police have had little success in takingdown Asiaâs drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leadershave been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according tothe AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcoticskingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more thana short period was in the mid-1970s. Thatâs when Ng Sik-ho, awily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentencedto 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opiumand morphine, according to court records.So far, Tse has avoided Limpy Hoâs fate. He is beingtracked, and all the signs are he knows it, saycounter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say theybelieve he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.(Reporting by Tom Allard. Additional reporting by ReutersStaff. Editing by Peter Hirschberg.)
EXCLUSIVE-Police chase suspected kingpin of vast Asian meth syndicate	By Tom AllardBANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - The largest ever task forceassembled to fight organized crime in Asia has identified along-time drug trafficker, a China-born Canadian national, asthe suspected kingpin of a crime syndicate that police saydominates the $70 billion-a-year Asia-Pacific drug trade.The suspected syndicate leader is Tse Chi Lop, 55, anex-convict who formerly lived in Toronto and has moved betweenMacau, Hong Kong and Taiwan in recent years, according tocounter-narcotics officers from four countries as well as lawenforcement documents reviewed by Reuters. Authorities have notpublicly identified Tse as the boss of the drug traffickinggroup.The syndicate he is suspected of running is known to itsmembers as âThe Company.â Law enforcers also refer to it as âSamGor,â or Brother Number Three in Cantonese, after one of Tseâsnicknames.The Australian Federal Police (AFP), which has taken thelead in the sprawling investigation, has compiled a list of topsyndicate members that identifies Tse as âthe senior leader ofthe Sam Gor syndicate.â The group, the list says, has âbeenconnected with or directly involved in at least 13 casesâ ofdrug trafficking since January 2015. The list, reviewed byReuters, does not provide specific details of the cases.A flow-chart of the syndicate in a Taiwanese law enforcementdocument identifies Tse as the âMultinational CEOâ of the SamGor syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)alert circulated among regional government agencies this yearsays Tse is âbelieved to beâ the leader of the syndicate.âBrother Number Three is target number one,â said one AFPofficer.Reuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response toquestions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwanâs Ministryof Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment oninvestigations.According to interviews with regional law enforcers fromeight countries, as well as a review of law enforcementdocuments, the syndicate produces vast quantities of high-grademethamphetamine in Myanmar and trafficks the drug to countriesstretching from Japan to New Zealand. The group isâconservativelyâ raking in $8 billion a year and could beearning as much as $17.7 billion annually, according to anestimate by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime(UNODC).âTse Chi Lop is in the league of El Chapo or maybe PabloEscobar,â said Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacificrepresentative for UNODC, referring to Latin Americaâs mostlegendary narco-traffickers. âThe word kingpin often gets thrownaround, but there is no doubt it applies here.âThe syndicate is the major factor in the fourfold increasein region-wide meth trafficking in the past five years, theUNODC says. The supply of the highly addictive drug has surged,causing the street price to plummet in many countries. In areport in July, the UN agency said the meth trade had reachedâunprecedented and dangerous levels,â and was a âdirectchallenge to the public security and health of the region.â<p/>TRIAD ALLIANCEThe AFP has identified 19 top syndicate leaders, four ofwhom are Canadian nationals, the target list shows. Othersuspected leaders hail from Hong Kong, Macau, mainland China,Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar and Vietnam. Some have links to drugtrafficking that go back decades, according to the target listand investigators from four countries, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.Tse has not been arrested. Counter-narcotics agents saidthey suspect he has long been aware he is under surveillance. Sofar, at least one senior member of the syndicate has beenarrested, according to investigators and police documents.Tse has previously been involved in drug trafficking. In thelate 1990s, he was arrested and extradited from Hong Kong to theUnited States on charges of conspiracy to import heroin intoAmerica. He was tried in New York and in 2000 sentenced to nineyears in prison, which he mostly served in the federalcorrectional institution in Elkton, Ohio.The investigation, which involves about a dozen countries,has been dubbed Operation Kungur. Counter-narcotics agenciesfrom China, Myanmar, the United States and Thailand are alsoleading participants, along with Australia. Taiwan, while not aformal member, is also assisting.At the core of the syndicate are at least five triad groupsthat originated in Hong Kong, Macau, China and Taiwan but whichhave global reach, AFP officers said. These are the 14K, WoShing Wo, Sun Yee On, the Big Circle Gang and the Bamboo Union.To get its drugs to market, the Sam Gor syndicate worksclosely with Japanâs Yakuza, Thai organized crime, andAustralian motorcycle gangs, among other crime groups, accordingto regional anti-narcotics agents and documents reviewed byReuters.According to regional police sources, the task force hasgathered phone intercepts of Tse talking about his drugbusiness, phone call logs linking him to other suspectedsyndicate members and surveillance footage of Tse with membersof the crime group. Reuters has been briefed on this evidencebut has not seen it.The UNODC estimates that the Asia-Pacific methamphetaminetrade alone was worth as much as $61.4 billion in 2018, up froman estimated $15 billion just five years earlier. Herointrafficking was worth up to $10.3 billion in 2018, it said.The syndicate is suspected to be the major player in boththe meth and heroin markets, producing the drugs as well as thehallucinogen ketamine in super-labs in Myanmarâs northeast,where ethnic armed groups control swathes of territory. Policealso say the syndicate traffics MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy,and cocaine sourced from Europe and Latin America respectively.The Myanmar government and police did not respond toquestions from Reuters.Authorities say the drugs are distributed via repurposedfishing vessels that traverse vast distances, hidden incontainers aboard other vessels, or transported by vehicles andcouriers with backpacks who walk along jungle tracks leading outof the syndicateâs production hub in the heart of SoutheastAsiaâs Golden Triangle.The full special report, The Hunt for Asiaâs El Chapo, canbe read here and here: https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meth-syndicate(Reporting by Tom Allard.

UPDATE 1-Russia jails U.S.-Israeli on drug charges despite Netanyahu plea	"(Releads with sentencing)By Tom Balmforth and Dan WilliamsMOSCOW/JERUSALEM, Oct 11 (Reuters) - A Russian courtsentenced a U.S.-Israeli woman to seven and a half years in jailfor drug offences on Friday, a ruling Israel condemned asdisproportionate and which her family said Moscow had linked tothe fate of a Russian citizen detained in Israel.Naama Issachar, 25, was arrested in April while in transitin a Moscow airport, en route from India to Israel, and accusedof carrying 9 grams of cannabis, her family said. Russianauthorities charged her with drug smuggling.On Thursday, Russia RT news channel suggested Issacharcould be traded for Alexei Burkov, a Russian detained whilevisiting Israel in 2015. Israeli officials say the United Stateswants to extradite Burkov for suspected cyber crimes.The RT report cited Burkov family as calling for theexchange. It said Burkov denied U.S. allegations against him.Minutes before Friday sentencing, Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu ruled out any swap of Issachar for Burkov.""Israeli justice officials have made unequivocally clearthat there is no possibility of preventing Burkov extraditionafter Israel Supreme Court ruled him extraditable,"" astatement by Netanyahu office said. It did not elaborate onwhether such a swap had been formally proposed.The statement said Netanyahu had twice discussed Issacharcase with Russian President Vladimir Putin and that Israel would""continue to exert every effort to free (her) and return her toher family"".U.S. officials had no immediate comment on either case.Israel Foreign Ministry said the ruling was ""heavy"" and""disproportionate"" given the circumstances of Issachar arrest- a reference to her having not intended to enter Russia withdrugs.Issachar uncle, Israel Cohen, described his niece as ""ahostage, abducted in order to bargain for a Russian hacker"".""As a mere (cannabis) possessor she was not in his(Burkov) league, so they (Russian authorities) shifted tocharges of smuggling and trafficking in order to raise hervalue,"" Cohen told Reuters.Asked to respond to the allegation, a spokesman for Russiaembassy in Israel said the Foreign Ministry in Moscow does notinterfere in Russian judicial affairs. According to the MoscowTimes newspaper, Russian authorities consider possession of morethan 6 grams of cannabis a criminal offence.(Writing by Dan Williams, Editing by Timothy Heritage and NickMacfie)"
Migrant protesters occupy U.S.-Mexico border bridge, crossing closed	"By Veronica G CardenasGATEWAY BRIDGE, U.S.-Mexico border (Reuters) - Migrants seeking asylum in the United States who are camped in a dangerous Mexican border town occupied a bridge to Brownsville, Texas on Thursday, leading U.S. authorities to close the crossing, witnesses and authorities said. Hundreds of the migrants have been sleeping for weeks on the end of the bridge in Matamoros, Mexico, a city known for gang violence and for cartels that control human trafficking.Many of those living in tents or on the sidewalk in a plaza abutting the bridge are awaiting court dates for hearings in the United States weeks or months later under a U.S. policy called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).Video shot by a Reuters photographer showed men, women and children, some lying on blankets, midway across the bridge over the Rio Grande. Dozens of U.S. border agents stood behind a gate topped with razor wire, which blocked the path into the United States.Some migrants said they were trying to cross as a group into the United States, and were frustrated that court dates kept being pushed backwards, leaving them uncertain of how long they would be stuck in Mexico.""We want to argue to cross over - we didn't ask to be in Mexico, they sent us here unjustly,"" said a man who declined to give his name.

Foreigners make up nearly half of death row inmates in Malaysia -Amnesty	"KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Capital punishment inMalaysia disproportionately affects foreign nationals, whoaccount for nearly half of those on death row, as well as womeninvolved in drug trafficking, Amnesty International said onThursday.It urged the Southeast Asian nation to abolish the deathpenalty for all offences.In March, Malaysia rowed back on plans to scrap the deathpenalty, saying that it would only abolish mandatory capitalpunishment for certain offences.Amnesty, in a report published on Thursday, said about 44%of 1,281 inmates on death row in Malaysia as of February thisyear were foreigners from countries such as Nigeria, Indonesia,Iran, India, and Thailand.The majority of 141 women on death row, most of whom wereconvicted of trafficking drugs into Malaysia, were also foreignnationals, it said, adding that the offence of drug traffickingdid not warrant the death penalty.""Several of these women were meant to travel to Malaysiawith their partner or friend, who at the last minute had to pullout of the trip for visa or other reasons,"" Shamini DarshniKaliemuthu, executive director of Amnesty InternationalMalaysia, told a press conference.""These cases were quite obviously of unwitting drug mules.""Its report found that many of those people sentenced to hangin Malaysia had been subjected to harsh treatment by authoritiesand received inadequate access to legal or consular services.They also faced unfair trials and, in some cases, were madeto sign documents in Malay without a translator present, despitenot speaking the language.The prime minister office did not immediately respond to arequest for comment on the report.Amnesty report drew on two years of research as well asinterviews with death row inmates, their lawyers, families andembassy officials, the group said.Malaysia must move toward abolishing the death penalty byscrapping the mandatory capital punishment for all crimes andmaintaining a moratorium on executions until then, Shamini said.""From allegations of torture and other ill-treatment to anopaque pardons process, it clear the death penalty is a stainon Malaysia criminal justice system,"" she said.(Reporting by Rozanna Latiff; Editing by Susan Fenton)"
EXCLUSIVE-As Trump grows frustrated on Venezuela, U.S. to 'squeeze' Cuba, scrutinize Russia	"By Matt Spetalnick and Luc CohenWASHINGTON/CARACAS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The Trumpadministration is preparing new sanctions on Cuba over itssupport for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and is taking a""closer look"" at Russia role in helping him remain in power,the U.S. special envoy on Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, toldReuters.President Donald Trump frustration over the failure ofhis ""maximum pressure"" campaign to unseat Maduro has spurredforeign policy aides to ready further U.S. actions and press fortougher sanctions on OPEC member Venezuela by European and LatinAmerican partners, a second senior administration official saidon condition of anonymity.Abrams said Washington sees Cuba and Russia providing alifeline to Maduro, nine months after the Trump administrationand dozens of other countries resolved to no longer recognizethe socialist leader as Venezuela legitimate president.""We're always looking to ways to squeeze (Cuba) because wedo not see any improvement in their conduct either with respectto Venezuela or human rights internally,"" Abrams said in aninterview in his State Department office.The new sanctions under consideration for communist Cuba,expected ""in the weeks ahead,"" would likely target the islandtourism sector as well as Venezuela cut-rate oil delivered toHavana, building on the U.S. blacklisting of tankers used totransport the supplies, the senior official said.While U.S. sanctions on Cuba stem from accusations that itprovides training, arms and intelligence to Maduro securityforces, targeting Russia would be based heavily on Moscowfinancial support of Caracas. Oil giant Rosneft hashelped Venezuela market its crude since Washington imposedsanctions on state oil company PDVSA in January.Asked whether Washington is preparing sanctions againstRosneft, Abrams said the administration was ""taking a closerlook at the ways in which Russia is sustaining the regime"" butdeclined to specify any entities or individuals.In early August, the Trump administration froze U.S. assetsof the Venezuelan government and threatened ""secondarysanctions"" on any company doing business with it, an escalationof pressure on Maduro. The move was widely seen as opening thedoor to putting sanctions on Rosneft, which in recent months hastaken around half of Venezuela crude exports.Abrams said the administration now intended to start ""namingnames"" under Trump August order and that new individualsanctions are expected over the next three months.But U.S. officials are mindful of the need for caution intargeting a company as large and far-reaching as Rosneft overits Venezuela ties.""We don't have the luxury of being haphazard,"" the senioradministration official told Reuters, stressing that they werenot specifically referring to Rosneft.""If it was a company that was solely doing business inVenezuela, that a slam dunk. But when you deal with entitiesthat have multiple components, we have to be thorough.""At the same time, the Trump administration recognizes therisk of adding tensions to an already-troubled U.S.-Russiarelationship at a time when the countries face geopoliticaldisagreements over issues like Syria, Ukraine and arms control.<p/>'WHY AREN'T WE DOING MORE?'With some critics saying the economic weapons at the Trumpadministration disposal are dwindling, it remains unclearwhether the remaining options will be enough to shift thebalance of power in Venezuela.Maduro retains the loyalty of the country military despiteopposition leader Juan Guaido efforts to get them on his sideafter he invoked the constitution to assume an interimpresidency in January, arguing Maduro 2018 re-election was afraud. Guaido leads the opposition-controlled National Assembly.Further restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba would beaimed at squeezing the island economically and expanding Trumpsteady rollback of the historic opening to Cuba by Trumppredecessor, Barack Obama. The reversal, along with his pressureon Venezuela, has gone over well among Cuban Americans in SouthFlorida, a key voting bloc in Trump 2020 re-election campaign.The senior administration official insisted Trump growingimpatience with the failure of sanctions and diplomatic pressureto push Maduro from power meant he would not ease up despite thepresident decision last month to fire his hawkish nationalsecurity adviser, John Bolton, who was widely identified withthe hardline policy on Venezuela.The official said that before the administration stepped uppressure in January as Guaido assumed the rival presidency, theprocess had been hampered by two years of ""slow-walking"" byother government agencies that preferred an incrementalapproach.""That the frustration that the president harbored - he'dbeen saying for two years, 'Why aren't we doing more?',"" theofficial said.However, a former senior U.S. official said theadministration underestimated the complexities of the Venezuelansituation, especially the difficulty of spurring a mutiny in theranks where many officers are suspected of benefiting fromcorruption and drug trafficking.Asked whether Venezuela policy would change with Boltondeparture, Abrams said: ""The policy of supporting Guaido,supporting the National Assembly, pushing for a return ofdemocracy, is not going to change.""(Editing by Mary Milliken and Cynthia Osterman)"

Special Report: A surge in killings by police roils Bolsonaro's Brazil	"By Gabriel StargardterSAO GONCALO, Brazil (Reuters) - Just before leaving her teaching job on the afternoon of May 17, Alessandra Mattos received a panicked voice message. ""Alessandra!"" a relative said. ""There been an accident with Brayan.""She grabbed her things, flagged a motorcycle taxi and rushed to a slum in the Rio de Janeiro suburb of Sao Goncalo. There, dead in a pool of blood, lay Brayan Mattos dos Santos, the 19-year-old nephew she helped raise. She tried to get closer, but a policeman blocked her advance. ""It wasn't me,"" Mattos said the officer told her. ""It wasn't me.""The ""accident,"" Mattos soon learned, was the sort of fate dreaded by families of young, dark-skinned men across South America most populous country. Black and mixed-race youths like dos Santos long have been disproportionately represented among homicide victims in Brazil, the country with the world highest number of murders. Now, amid a crackdown on suspected criminals championed by President Jair Bolsonaro, they are increasingly dying at the hands of police. No weapons, narcotics or other illegal materials were found on dos Santos, a car and motorcycle enthusiast who had recently begun driving for Uber. He appears, instead, to have been at the wrong place at the wrong time â near a street stall for illegal drugs just as a police raid went down. His death, in a state where killings by police have climbed by 16% this year, according to government figures, is being investigated by Rio prosecutors. The raid is one of many lethal operations that human rights activists, some Rio residents and opposition lawmakers see as part of a bloody and illegal campaign to clean up historically violent neighbourhoods across Latin America biggest country.Emboldened by victories last year of far-right politicians with aggressive law-and-order agendas, Brazil police forces are surpassing their own longstanding reputations for being among the most violent in the world. The slain include victims like dos Santos, who had no known criminal ties. In late September, hundreds gathered in northern Rio to grieve the death of an eight-year-old girl who was shot, according to bystanders, by a policeman who missed when aiming at a motorcyclist. Her death, one of several children allegedly shot by police this year, is still being investigated.Two top commanders of Rio military and civil police forces, which together are responsible for security in the state, told Reuters that police have never received or issued orders to kill. Officers, rather, are finding themselves in more violent confrontations because of a nearly 50% increase in the number of raids, a response to higher crime. ""An officer never has the objective of killing,"" said Fabio Barucke, operational head of the civil police. ""But we have a responsibility to defend ourselves.""Rio, a state of 17 million people that includes the seaside metropolis of the same name, has long been known as a hotbed of conflict between criminal gangs and sometimes trigger-happy police. Now, with Bolsonaro and a like-minded governor urging lawmen to get even tougher, tensions, violence and the death toll are mounting. Bolsonaro is seeking to boost legal protections for police who kill on the job, proposing in a bill to lessen sentences for officers who shoot because of ""excusable fear, surprise or violent emotion."" He has said criminals should ""die like cockroaches."" Wilson Witzel, Rio governor, has ordered snipers to fire on suspects from helicopters. Witzel recently told foreign journalists that suspects, when confronted by police, should ""surrender or die.""To some in the political opposition, the rhetoric of Brazil new leaders is reminiscent of Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippine president whose offensive against drug dealers has led to thousands of killings by police. ""The police feel authorized to kill,"" said Marcelo Freixo, a congressman from Rio and veteran researcher on violence and organised crime. ""The discourse stimulates violence.""Reuters found no evidence that Bolsonaro, Witzel or other right-wing leaders elected in a wave of populist protest last year have ordered police to break laws or methodically kill criminal suspects. Bolsonaro justice minister, Sergio Moro, told Reuters that the administration doesn't advocate police violence.  ""Confrontations between police and criminals are always undesirable,"" he said in an interview in Brasilia, the capital. ""You don't resolve public security with confrontations, but with intelligence, strategy, due process and state presence.""Between January and August 2019, Rio police killed 1,249 people, according to official figures, nearly a fifth more than a year ago. The rate amounts to 5 people per day, more for the period than any since the state began keeping its current database in 2003. By contrast, 14 police officers have died in operations this year, down from 24 killed on duty between January and August 2018. Recent nationwide figures aren't available, but killings by police have also climbed in Sao Paulo, Brazil most populous state, and other major urban areas. Like dos Santos, most victims of police killings are dark-skinned, a reflection of the socioeconomic and racial makeup of poor neighbourhoods where most drug traffickers and other criminal gangs operate. Although whites make up half the population in Rio, they accounted for 12% of those killed by police early this year, according to government data obtained by Reuters via a freedom of information request. It impossible to calculate how many of the victims are believed to have been innocent bystanders. Human-rights activists, however, say they believe that the surge in killings indicates some police are out to kill, regardless of any evidence or the risk of collateral damage. ""These numbers aren't those of a few murders,"" said Freixo, the congressman. ""They are numbers of execution, of extermination.""Officially, many of the deaths in police operations are attributed to ""resistance"" by suspects. Police, wary of heavily armed gangs, argue they have little choice but to shoot in self defence, especially in labyrinthine slums where gangs can easily ambush them.But local and international activists have for decades decried excessive force and outright executions by police.The problem predates Bolsonaro. After a 2003 visit to Brazil, a special rapporteur for the United Nations Commission on Human Rights wrote that she was ""overwhelmed with information about human rights violations."" She criticized Brazil government, especially some state administrations, because they ""fail to fully accept the existence of extrajudicial and summary executions."" In early September, Michelle Bachelet, a former Chilean president who is now the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, criticized Brazil for ""discourse legitimising summary executions."" In response, Bolsonaro criticized Bachelet for pursuing the agenda ""of criminals"" and ""attacking our valiant police.""Dos Santos died at the hands of Rio 7th Military Police Battalion, the state most lethal. The unit, one of 39 battalions in Rio, since 2003 has killed 1,055 people. Through August, 137 civilians this year have died in operations involving the 7th, 35 more than any other battalion in the state.The 7th operates ""in very complex geography,"" said Rogerio Figueredo, commander of Rio military police force. ""There are various communities with several criminal factions all disputing the territory.""According to a police report reviewed by Reuters, dos Santos' death may have been accidental. Officers, the report said, returned fire after being shot at by suspects. Dos Santos died because of ""intervention by a state agent.""To understand his killing and the recent rise in the body count, Reuters spoke to police and government officials, security experts, human rights researchers, and friends and family of dos Santos. The picture that emerges, including exclusive details about the May raid in Sao Goncalo, is that of an entrenched conflict worsening amid the law-and-order agenda of a new populist leadership.<p/>""WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR""The very structure of Brazilian police forces has long been controversial. After a two-decade military dictatorship that ended in the 1980s, a new constitution gave responsibility for most law enforcement to each of Brazil 26 states. Rather than reinvent their forces, the states kept a military format for police charged with everyday law enforcement. A ""civil police"" force were made responsible for investigations and working with prosecutors. But the beat cops and routine patrols that most Brazilians encounter still operate within a highly regimented, militaristic structure.As a result, everything from the fortresslike architecture of police stations to the language used by officers still reflects a barracks mentality. Training is often phrased in terms of ""us"" against ""them."" Criminals are ""the enemy.""""The mold is that of the military,"" said Fernando Salema, a former commander of the 7th battalion who is now a lawmaker, from Bolsonaro party, in the Rio state assembly. ""We inherited that culture.""That culture is often in sharp relief in Rio. Clashes are as much a part of the landscape as its verdant hillsides and dramatic juxtaposition of rich and poor. Shootouts and the hum of police helicopters are a daily reality for many in a state where haphazard planning led slums and wealthy neighbourhoods to co-exist in a dense urban tangle. Sao Goncalo, a hardscrabble suburb across the bay that carves Rio coastline, in recent decades became one of the state most violent areas. Per capita income, about $4,000 a year, is similar to that of El Salvador and less than a third the level in the city of Rio. Once an industrial centre, Sao Goncalo has increasingly become a base for criminal gangs who smuggle drugs and weapons through the bay and hijack nearby highway cargo. It also one of many areas around Rio where so-called ""militias,"" violent criminal enterprises made up of retired and off-duty police, control extortion rackets and other illegal ventures. In 2011, Patricia Acioli, a state judge who jailed dozens of corrupt Sao Goncalo police, was shot 21 times outside her home. Eleven officers from the 7th, including its chief, were convicted of planning and executing the murder.""Sao Goncalo is a giant favela,"" or slum, said another recent commander of the 7th. The officer, who now leads another battalion and spoke on condition of anonymity, said crime is so common it seeps into the force. ""It has a corrupt population, and the officers come from the same.""  Earlier this decade, as Rio prepared to host the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, locals in Sao Goncalo complained yet more criminals were moving in because of a police cleanup near beaches, hotels and sporting venues. When a deep recession took root shortly thereafter, crime worsened across Brazil. In 2017, a record 64,000 murders were reported nationwide, more than in any other country. Already exasperated with the downturn and a far-reaching corruption scandal, voters swung sharply right, electing Bolsonaro and other populist conservatives last year. A former fringe congressman with little record as a lawmaker, Bolsonaro was best known for incendiary comments, including a 2015 quip in which he said police ""should kill more."" Witzel, a former judge, was unfamiliar to most of Rio electorate until he too outmanoeuvred veteran rivals with promises to purge crime. After taking office in January, the two politicians embraced their law-and-order mandate. Witzel rode along with rifle-wielding police in a helicopter and posted the video online, promising to ""bring peace back."" In an opinion piece in a local newspaper, he said the surge in police killings ""isn't difficult to justify.""Some police say they felt invigorated. ""It what we want to hear,"" Salema, the former commander turned assemblyman, told Reuters.<p/>""NO OTHER OPTION""    On Salema old beat, police this year began struggling with an internecine war within the local branch of the Comando Vermelho, or CV, one of Brazil most powerful drug gangs. After one CV boss in April killed a rival, fighting between factions spilled onto the streets. Gun battles erupted across Sao Goncalo, and schools, hospitals and bus routes shut down. The violence soon spread to other parts of Rio, prompting operations by police seeking to track down those responsible. In Mare, a slum near Rio international airport, a police helicopter on May 6 flew overhead and began shooting, according to local residents. By the end of the operation, police had killed eight suspects, including four who had been surrounded after running into a home. A resident of the home told state prosecutors she hid in another room and heard the confrontation. A prosecutor, speaking on condition of anonymity, gave Reuters details of her account. When police entered, the resident told prosecutors, two of the men gave up. But the officers rejected their surrender, according to the resident, replying, ""our order is to kill."" The police then shot the two men and, finding the other two suspects on the roof, shot them, too. Before a forensics team could arrive, the resident told prosecutors, the police dragged the four bodies outside. The officers, the prosecutor said, told investigators they only fired after being shot at. Rio civil police force, which ordered and conducted the operation, said it is still carrying out its own investigation and couldn't comment on specifics of the raid. Eleven days later, in Sao Goncalo, officers from the 7th battalion conducted the raid that killed dos Santos. As part of their efforts to curb gang activity, police had targeted a point of sale for drugs in the Sao Goncalo slum of Chumbada.Around 4:40 p.m., according to the police report reviewed by Reuters, at least four officers neared the drug stall and split into two teams. One team, Captain Renato de Souza and Sargent Andre Ricardo Mendes, took one path toward the stall. A second, Corporal Erik Ribeiro and Corporal Alex Dias, took another.Reuters was unable to confirm the details of the police report independently. Police officials declined a request to speak with the officers. As the operation got underway, dos Santos had gone to a shop in Chumbada to buy clothes for a party that evening, according to Mattos, his aunt. She showed Reuters a credit card receipt for the purchase, which she said came from dos Santos' telephone, valued at 217.79 reais, or about $53. ""It expensive here,"" dos Santos texted a friend in a message, seen by Reuters, about 10 minutes before the raid began. According to statements the officers gave civil police investigators, Ribeiro and Dias were approaching the stall when gunfire burst from a group of about six people. It isn't clear from the report who within that group is alleged to have fired.The officers, carrying high-caliber rifles made by Imbel, a Brazilian state-owned manufacturer of military weaponry, said they returned fire. Ribeiro fired 23 times, Dias 31.During the firefight, Ribeiro told investigators, one person fell to the ground ""near a shop."" Two others fled on a Honda motorcycle; several more escaped on foot. Another man, his shirt stained by a bullet wound in the shoulder, put his hands up and dropped to the ground.Ribeiro and Dias approached the drug stall as the other two officers pursued the motorcycle. The injured man, still prone and unarmed, told police he had gone there to buy marijuana. Several meters beyond the stall, on a residential street, lay dos Santos. Renato Perez, a civil police chief in Sao Goncalo with knowledge of the raid, told Reuters he suspected dos Santos had gone there to buy marijuana. He offered no evidence or documentation to support that claim. Mattos, the aunt, denied the assertion, saying her nephew didn't use drugs.""They always have to invent something,"" she said. Mendes and de Souza, the officers who chased the motorcycle, caught up with the two suspects on a nearby street. According to the police report, one of the men carried 65.2 grams of marijuana and a 9 mm pistol with two bullets and its serial number scraped off. The other carried 49.7 grams of cocaine and a walkie-talkie. The two were detained and charged with resisting arrest and possession of narcotics. They are awaiting trial, according to Rio public defenders' office and state court filings. No other suspects were apprehended and no other weapons were found. Danielle Costa, the civil police investigator who authored the report, concluded the officers had acted legitimately. They had ""no other option,"" she wrote, but to ""use their firearms, in legitimate defence and to overcome resistance posed by lawbreakers.""The civil police declined to make Costa available for an interview.State prosecutors are probing the operation. Andrea Amin, a Rio prosecutor who investigates police killings, in an interview told Reuters the law-and-order rhetoric risks legitimising excessive force and a lack of due process.

Special Report: A surge in killings by police roils Bolsonaro's Brazil	"By Gabriel StargardterSAO GONCALO, Brazil (Reuters) - Just before leaving her teaching job on the afternoon of May 17, Alessandra Mattos received a panicked voice message. ""Alessandra!"" a relative said. ""There been an accident with Brayan.""She grabbed her things, flagged a motorcycle taxi and rushed to a slum in the Rio de Janeiro suburb of Sao Goncalo. There, dead in a pool of blood, lay Brayan Mattos dos Santos, the 19-year-old nephew she helped raise. She tried to get closer, but a policeman blocked her advance. ""It wasn't me,"" Mattos said the officer told her. ""It wasn't me.""The ""accident,"" Mattos soon learned, was the sort of fate dreaded by families of young, dark-skinned men across South America most populous country. Black and mixed-race youths like dos Santos long have been disproportionately represented among homicide victims in Brazil, the country with the world highest number of murders. Now, amid a crackdown on suspected criminals championed by President Jair Bolsonaro, they are increasingly dying at the hands of police. No weapons, narcotics or other illegal materials were found on dos Santos, a car and motorcycle enthusiast who had recently begun driving for Uber. He appears, instead, to have been at the wrong place at the wrong time â near a street stall for illegal drugs just as a police raid went down. His death, in a state where killings by police have climbed by 16% this year, according to government figures, is being investigated by Rio prosecutors. The raid is one of many lethal operations that human rights activists, some Rio residents and opposition lawmakers see as part of a bloody and illegal campaign to clean up historically violent neighborhoods across Latin America biggest country.Emboldened by victories last year of far-right politicians with aggressive law-and-order agendas, Brazil police forces are surpassing their own longstanding reputations for being among the most violent in the world. The slain include victims like dos Santos, who had no known criminal ties. In late September, hundreds gathered in northern Rio to grieve the death of an eight-year-old girl who was shot, according to bystanders, by a policeman who missed when aiming at a motorcyclist. Her death, one of several children allegedly shot by police this year, is still being investigated.Two top commanders of Rio military and civil police forces, which together are responsible for security in the state, told Reuters that police have never received or issued orders to kill.

By contrast, 14 police officers have died inoperations this year, down from 24 killed on duty betweenJanuary and August 2018.Recent nationwide figures aren't available, but killings bypolice have also climbed in Sao Paulo, Brazil most populousstate, and other major urban areas.Like dos Santos, most victims of police killings aredark-skinned, a reflection of the socioeconomic and racialmakeup of poor neighborhoods where most drug traffickers andother criminal gangs operate. Although whites make up half thepopulation in Rio, they accounted for 12% of those killed bypolice early this year, according to government data obtained byReuters via a freedom of information request.It impossible to calculate how many of the victims arebelieved to have been innocent bystanders. Human-rightsactivists, however, say they believe that the surge in killingsindicates some police are out to kill, regardless of anyevidence or the risk of collateral damage.""These numbers aren't those of a few murders,"" said Freixo,the congressman. ""They are numbers of execution, ofextermination.""Officially, many of the deaths in police operations areattributed to ""resistance"" by suspects. Police, wary of heavilyarmed gangs, argue they have little choice but to shoot in selfdefense, especially in labyrinthine slums where gangs can easilyambush them.But local and international activists have for decadesdecried excessive force and outright executions by police.The problem predates Bolsonaro.After a 2003 visit to Brazil, a special rapporteur for theUnited Nations Commission on Human Rights wrote that she was""overwhelmed with information about human rights violations.""She criticized Brazil government, especially some stateadministrations, because they ""fail to fully accept theexistence of extrajudicial and summary executions.""In early September, Michelle Bachelet, a former Chileanpresident who is now the UN High Commissioner for HumanRights, criticized Brazil for ""discourse legitimizing summaryexecutions."" In response, Bolsonaro criticized Bachelet forpursuing the agenda ""of criminals"" and ""attacking our valiantpolice.""Dos Santos died at the hands of Rio 7th Military PoliceBattalion, the state most lethal. The unit, one of 39battalions in Rio, since 2003 has killed 1,055 people. ThroughAugust, 137 civilians this year have died in operationsinvolving the 7th, 35 more than any other battalion in thestate.The 7th operates ""in very complex geography,"" said RogerioFigueredo, commander of Rio military police force. ""There arevarious communities with several criminal factions all disputingthe territory.""According to a police report reviewed by Reuters, dosSantos' death may have been accidental. Officers, the reportsaid, returned fire after being shot at by suspects. Dos Santosdied because of ""intervention by a state agent.""To understand his killing and the recent rise in the bodycount, Reuters spoke to police and government officials,security experts, human rights researchers, and friends andfamily of dos Santos. The picture that emerges, includingexclusive details about the May raid in Sao Goncalo, is that ofan entrenched conflict worsening amid the law-and-order agendaof a new populist leadership.""WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR""The very structure of Brazilian police forces has long beencontroversial.After a two-decade military dictatorship that ended in the1980s, a new constitution gave responsibility for most lawenforcement to each of Brazil 26 states. Rather than reinventtheir forces, the states kept a military format for policecharged with everyday law enforcement.A ""civil police"" force were made responsible forinvestigations and working with prosecutors. But the beat copsand routine patrols that most Brazilians encounter still operatewithin a highly regimented, militaristic structure.As a result, everything from the fortresslike architectureof police stations to the language used by officers stillreflects a barracks mentality. Training is often phrased interms of ""us"" against ""them."" Criminals are ""the enemy.""""The mold is that of the military,"" said Fernando Salema, aformer commander of the 7th battalion who is now a lawmaker,from Bolsonaro party, in the Rio state assembly. ""We inheritedthat culture.""That culture is often in sharp relief in Rio.Clashes are as much a part of the landscape as its verdanthillsides and dramatic juxtaposition of rich and poor. Shootoutsand the hum of police helicopters are a daily reality for manyin a state where haphazard planning led slums and wealthyneighborhoods to co-exist in a dense urban tangle.Sao Goncalo, a hardscrabble suburb across the bay thatcarves Rio coastline, in recent decades became one of thestate most violent areas. Per capita income, about $4,000 ayear, is similar to that of El Salvador and less than a thirdthe level in the city of Rio.Once an industrial center, Sao Goncalo has increasinglybecome a base for criminal gangs who smuggle drugs and weaponsthrough the bay and hijack nearby highway cargo. It also oneof many areas around Rio where so-called ""militias,"" violentcriminal enterprises made up of retired and off-duty police,control extortion rackets and other illegal ventures.In 2011, Patricia Acioli, a state judge who jailed dozens ofcorrupt Sao Goncalo police, was shot 21 times outside her home.Eleven officers from the 7th, including its chief, wereconvicted of planning and executing the murder.""Sao Goncalo is a giant favela,"" or slum, said anotherrecent commander of the 7th. The officer, who now leads anotherbattalion and spoke on condition of anonymity, said crime is socommon it seeps into the force. ""It has a corrupt population,and the officers come from the same.""Earlier this decade, as Rio prepared to host the 2014 WorldCup and 2016 Olympics, locals in Sao Goncalo complained yet morecriminals were moving in because of a police cleanup nearbeaches, hotels and sporting venues. When a deep recession tookroot shortly thereafter, crime worsened across Brazil. In 2017,a record 64,000 murders were reported nationwide, more than inany other country.Already exasperated with the downturn and a far-reachingcorruption scandal, voters swung sharply right, electingBolsonaro and other populist conservatives last year. A formerfringe congressman with little record as a lawmaker, Bolsonarowas best known for incendiary comments, including a 2015 quip inwhich he said police ""should kill more.""Witzel, a former judge, was unfamiliar to most of Rioelectorate until he too outmaneuvered veteran rivals withpromises to purge crime.After taking office in January, the two politicians embracedtheir law-and-order mandate. Witzel rode along withrifle-wielding police in a helicopter and posted the videoonline, promising to ""bring peace back."" In an opinion piece ina local newspaper, he said the surge in police killings ""isn'tdifficult to justify.""Some police say they felt invigorated. ""It what we want tohear,"" Salema, the former commander turned assemblyman, toldReuters.<p/>""NO OTHER OPTION""On Salema old beat, police this year began struggling withan internecine war within the local branch of the ComandoVermelho, or CV, one of Brazil most powerful drug gangs. Afterone CV boss in April killed a rival, fighting between factionsspilled onto the streets. Gun battles erupted across SaoGoncalo, and schools, hospitals and bus routes shut down.The violence soon spread to other parts of Rio, promptingoperations by police seeking to track down those responsible. InMare, a slum near Rio international airport, a policehelicopter on May 6 flew overhead and began shooting, accordingto local residents.By the end of the operation, police had killed eightsuspects, including four who had been surrounded after runninginto a home. A resident of the home told state prosecutors shehid in another room and heard the confrontation. A prosecutor,speaking on condition of anonymity, gave Reuters details of heraccount.When police entered, the resident told prosecutors, two ofthe men gave up. But the officers rejected their surrender,according to the resident, replying, ""our order is to kill.""The police then shot the two men and, finding the other twosuspects on the roof, shot them, too. Before a forensics teamcould arrive, the resident told prosecutors, the police draggedthe four bodies outside.The officers, the prosecutor said, told investigators theyonly fired after being shot at. Rio civil police force, whichordered and conducted the operation, said it is still carryingout its own investigation and couldn't comment on specifics ofthe raid.Eleven days later, in Sao Goncalo, officers from the 7thbattalion conducted the raid that killed dos Santos. As part oftheir efforts to curb gang activity, police had targeted a pointof sale for drugs in the Sao Goncalo slum of Chumbada.Around 4:40 p.m., according to the police report reviewed byReuters, at least four officers neared the drug stall and splitinto two teams. One team, Captain Renato de Souza and SargentAndre Ricardo Mendes, took one path toward the stall. A second,Corporal Erik Ribeiro and Corporal Alex Dias, took another.Reuters was unable to confirm the details of the policereport independently. Police officials declined a request tospeak with the officers.As the operation got underway, dos Santos had gone to a shopin Chumbada to buy clothes for a party that evening, accordingto Mattos, his aunt. She showed Reuters a credit card receiptfor the purchase, which she said came from dos Santos'telephone, valued at 217.79 reais, or about $53.""It expensive here,"" dos Santos texted a friend in amessage, seen by Reuters, about 10 minutes before the raidbegan.According to statements the officers gave civil policeinvestigators, Ribeiro and Dias were approaching the stall whengunfire burst from a group of about six people. It isn't clearfrom the report who within that group is alleged to have fired.The officers, carrying high-caliber rifles made by Imbel, aBrazilian state-owned manufacturer of military weaponry, saidthey returned fire. Ribeiro fired 23 times, Dias 31.During the firefight, Ribeiro told investigators, one personfell to the ground ""near a shop."" Two others fled on a Hondamotorcycle; several more escaped on foot. Another man, his shirtstained by a bullet wound in the shoulder, put his hands up anddropped to the ground.Ribeiro and Dias approached the drug stall as the other twoofficers pursued the motorcycle. The injured man, still proneand unarmed, told police he had gone there to buy marijuana.Several meters beyond the stall, on a residential street, laydos Santos.Renato Perez, a civil police chief in Sao Goncalo withknowledge of the raid, told Reuters he suspected dos Santos hadgone there to buy marijuana. He offered no evidence ordocumentation to support that claim. Mattos, the aunt, deniedthe assertion, saying her nephew didn't use drugs.""They always have to invent something,"" she said.Mendes and de Souza, the officers who chased the motorcycle,caught up with the two suspects on a nearby street. According tothe police report, one of the men carried 65.2 grams ofmarijuana and a 9 mm pistol with two bullets and its serialnumber scraped off. The other carried 49.7 grams of cocaine anda walkie-talkie.The two were detained and charged with resisting arrest andpossession of narcotics. They are awaiting trial, according toRio public defenders' office and state court filings. No othersuspects were apprehended and no other weapons were found.Danielle Costa, the civil police investigator who authoredthe report, concluded the officers had acted legitimately. Theyhad ""no other option,"" she wrote, but to ""use their firearms, inlegitimate defense and to overcome resistance posed bylawbreakers.""The civil police declined to make Costa available for aninterview.State prosecutors are probing the operation.Andrea Amin, a Rio prosecutor who investigates policekillings, in an interview told Reuters the law-and-orderrhetoric risks legitimizing excessive force and a lack of dueprocess.

Deep in Guatemala's jungle, drugs and murder are new neighbors to palm oil	"By Sofia MenchuSEMUY II, Guatemala, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Bulletholes scar awall in the only school in Semuy II, a remote village innortheastern Guatemala where three soldiers were shot dead earlyin September as they searched for jungle landing strips used bydrug traffickers.In the village school classrooms, books and open notebooksgathered dust on the desks, while on a board, the fateful dateof the shootings was written in red ink: ""September 3.""President Jimmy Morales said the soldiers were killed byvillagers protecting a drug shipment. In response, thegovernment gave the army temporary emergency powers over a vastswathe of surrounding territory, leading to some startlingdiscoveries.Searches uncovered coca plantations and cocainelaboratories, including in Semuy II municipality of El Estor,suggesting drug gangs have been operating freely in an areabetter known for its natural beauty, mining and African palm.The deaths occurred on the fringes of the Pataxte estate thatsupplies palm oil to Nestle and Cargill, withauthorities saying landing strips on the estate had been used bytraffickers.""We've found landing strips, some of them clandestine. Thereare some strips that are legal, but there evidence of planeslanding with illicit goods,"" General Luis Alberto Morales,deputy head of the presidential general staff, told Reuters.Ministry of Defense spokesman Oscar Perez said investigatorshad also found the remains of torched planes in the wider area,a tell-tale sign the strips were being used for trafficking.The discovery is a dramatic development in the drug war thatbrings fields and laboratories used to make cocaine closer tothe U.S. market than ever before.The development led Guatemala interior minister to declarethat the country was now a cocaine producing nation - adistinction previously reserved for Andean countries in SouthAmerica.Images provided by the government of the army discoveriesshow what appears to be a well-built laboratory, which Moralessaid could produce up to half a tonne of cocaine a day. He saidthe government had discovered 1.5 million coca plants along withthe labs, estimating a street value of $800 million.Such numbers may be inflated. While Andean plantations varywidely in density of plants per hectare, it would be hard to fitso many plants on the apparently small areas of land so fardiscovered by the soldiers in the wake of the killings. Onlylast year, Guatemala discovered a small field of coca for thefirst time.However, the discovery of sophisticated laboratories fitswith recent trends of Colombian gangs exporting half-processedcocaine to finish the product in countries with less strictpolicing, said Hernando Bernal, an official from the UnitedNations drugs and crime agency illicit crop monitoringprogram.The U.S. embassy in Guatemala declined to comment for thisstory.<p/>FEAR, ISOLATIONThe events of Tuesday, Sept. 3 are murky. Around noon, apatrol of nine soldiers with weapons at the ready tried to crossthe village of Semuy II, the first time military officials hadbeen seen in years, locals and authorities agree. At this point,the versions diverge.Authorities say the villagers ambushed the soldiers and shotthree of them behind the school. Villagers say soldiers sparkeda dispute and fired off rounds into the air, and then armedlocals opened fire on the soldiers.However, none could say who had fired the fatal shots and noone has been arrested by the investigating authorities.Speaking in the hills behind the village where he farmscocoa, community leader Vicente Perez, 43, denied thegovernment accusation that the villagers were growing drugsand protecting traffickers.""Everything the president is saying is a lie,"" Perez said.While he did not witness the shootings, he said it seemed thatcollective fear led the situation to spiral out of control.Soldiers and police had not been seen in the area since hewas a child, during Guatemala civil war, he said, adding thatthe soldiers should have requested permission from the elders ofthe village before passing through.According to Edgar Caal, a marine who survived the attack,more than a hundred locals waited with shotguns, machetes,sticks and stones, and before attacking issued the patrol awarning: ""Whoever comes to this village is already a dead man,""he related in a video released by the government.""We ran for our lives,"" the young marine said from ahospital bed while the camera took in other injured comradeswith scars on their hands, wrists and backs.<p/>PALM ESTATESAny uptick in violence and drug trafficking in the areacould create problems for local producers of palm oil, theworld second-most popular type of oil, used in consumerproducts ranging from soap to chocolate.Wedged between a jungle-clad hillside and a sprawling palmestate, Semuy II is built on land donated by NaturAceites, acompany owned by one of Guatemala richest families, whichdelivers the oil to commodities giants Cargill and Nestle.""Ten strips belonging to NaturAceites have been found in thearea. That doesn't mean that the (company) is using them, butthey have been used by people who engage in illegaltrafficking,"" Morales, the general, said.NaturAceites said the killings were unrelated to itsoperations and did not take place on its land. It said it hadtwo airstrips in the area and that every unauthorized landing onits property had been reported to the Guatemalan authorities.Reuters could not independently verify the number ofNaturAceites landing strips in the area.Hector Herrera, sustainability director at the company, saidthe government should do more to improve the quality of life forthe locals, most of whom eke out a hard-scrabble existencewithout basic services.""What is required in the area is the permanent and holisticpresence of the state to provide solutions to what thecommunities lack,"" he said.In reply to requests for comment on the killings, drug tradeand conditions in Semuy II, Nestle said it was ""immediatelycontacting all our suppliers who supply directly fromNaturAceites to gather further information."" Cargill said thatto date, NaturAceites had been found to be operating to itsstandards but that if it were found to be acting illegally itwould take action.Some Semuy II villagers said they were afraid both of themilitary camped out under the towering palms, and of what thefuture holds once the soldiers leave.Ruth Rax, a 30-year-old housewife who lives opposite theschool where the marines were gunned down, said in Q'eqchi shesaw villagers open fire, but did not know who shot the soldiers.""We don't know how this will end once the military havegone,"" she said.(Reporting by Sofia Menchu, additional reporting by Diego Ore;Writing by Dave Graham; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and RosalbaO'Brien)"

EXPLAINER-U.S. drug trial of Honduran president's brother	"By Delphine SchrankOct 3 (Reuters) - A U.S. prosecutor on Wednesday accusedHonduran politician Juan Antonio ""Tony"" Hernandez of smugglingtons of cocaine into the United States under the protection ofhis brother, President Juan Orlando Hernandez.In his opening statement in a Manhattan federal court,Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Richman said Tony Hernandezpersonally took a bribe for his brother from Mexican drug lordJoaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.Tony Hernandez pleaded not guilty. His lawyer denied he tookpart in drug trafficking or took any bribes.A lawyer for Guzman also denied his client made the pay off.President Hernandez said on Twitter that the allegationsagainst him were ""100% false, absurd and ridiculous,"" andreiterated denials he was involved in narcotrafficking.The trial for his brother is unfolding as Hernandezadministration faces intense pressure from U.S. President DonaldTrump to curb migration to the United States.Last week, Trump stood side-by-side with the Honduran leaderin New York, giving a thumbs up, as the countries struck a dealunder which Honduras would take in more asylum seekers.IS HONDURAS INVOLVED IN THE DRUG TRADE?With its Caribbean and Pacific coastline, the small CentralAmerican country has a long history as a corridor for cocaine,primarily from Colombia and Venezuela.It emerged as the key shipment point from South America inthe early 2000s after law enforcement broke up routes throughthe Caribbean, according to the United Nations Office on Drugand Crime.Cocaine flows to Honduras surged after a coup oustedthen-President Manuel Zelaya in 2009. The drugs generallyentered either by boat or clandestine airstrips.By 2010, roughly 65 tons of the 80 tons of cocainetransported to the United States by air landed in Honduras,which represented 15% of U.S.-bound cocaine flow, according tothe UN.HOW DID TONY HERNANDEZ END UP ON TRIAL?In 2012, bowing to U.S. pressure, Honduran PresidentPorfirio Lobo signed a bilateral treaty to extraditenarcotraffickers. Juan Orlando Hernandez, then president ofCongress, pushed it through the legislative branch.The first to be extradited was Carlos Arnoldo ""El Negro""Lobo in May 2014, after Hernandez won the presidency on a ticketto clean the streets of drug gangs and stepped up cooperationwith U.S. authorities. A U.S. court sentenced Lobo in December2014 to 20 years in prison, followed by five years of supervisedrelease, for conspiracy to distribute cocaine.The president brother Tony Hernandez, a lawyer and formerlawmaker, was arrested in Miami on Nov. 23, 2018. The unsealedindictment called him a ""large-scale drug trafficker"" whooperated in Colombia, Honduras and Mexico to import cocaine tothe United States.A leader of the Cachiros cartel had testified against him ina March 2017 trial in New York, saying he had taken a bribe tohelp launder drug funds. Hernandez lawyer has denied this.WAS PRESIDENT HERNANDEZ MENTIONED IN THE CASE?In a pre-trial motion filed in August by the U.S.government, prosecutors in the case alleged that as congressmanand presidential candidate, and then as president, Hernandezattempted to shield his brother from extradition.While his name is redacted, the document identifies""co-conspirator 4"" as the man sworn in as Honduran president inJanuary 2014.The August court filing alleges that Tony Hernandez and hisco-conspirators â including co-conspirator 4 - sought to enrichthemselves and finance campaigns by the National Party usingillicit drug funds, including Hernandez successful 2013presidential campaign.President Hernandez has not commented on the specifics ofthe allegations in the August court filing but he has repeatedlydenied any involvement in narcotics trafficking.In a speech at the United Nations last week, he describedallegations of his links to trafficking as a ""dirty smearcampaign"" by criminals in revenge for his efforts to dismantleorganized crime in Honduras.On Wednesday, his office said the government had broken upthe six most powerful drug cartels in Honduras and initiatedextradition proceedings for at least 24 people to the UnitedStates.President Hernandez told a news conference on Thursday,responding to the accusations against his brother: ""Nobody isabove the law.""""I've never intervened, nor will I, to protect anybody - notfriends, nor fellow party members, nor family members -absolutely nobody.""(Reporting by Delphine Schrank in Mexico City, Editing byRosalba O'Brien)"

Nazi relics from secret hoard unveiled at Argentina's Holocaust Museum	"By Marina LammertynBUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Busts of German dictator Adolf Hitler and other Nazi relics that belonged to a hoard found in a collector secret hiding place will go on display at the Holocaust Museum in Argentina, where many high-ranking Nazis fled after the end of World War Two.Along with the busts of the Nazi leader, objects going on display in December include a statue of a Germanic eagle standing on a base bearing a swastika, an hourglass that belonged to a member of Hitler feared SS, and games to indoctrinate children in Nazism.""These elements will show part of that terrible story that was the Nazi genocide,"" Marcelo Mindlin, president of the museum in the capital Buenos Aires, said in an interview at a news conference where the objects were on display. Argentina is home to Latin America largest Jewish population. The museum, which opened in 2001, is the only Holocaust museum in Latin America, according to museum officials. It will have a grand reopening at the beginning of December after a renovation to add exhibits to its original collection of photos and other Nazi propaganda.""The great surprise of these objects was that they could not have belonged to anyone but someone in the Nazi hierarchy,"" Mindlin added. The artefacts were examined by Argentine and German experts, who confirmed they came from the Nazi regime.The stash was found in 2017 in the home of Carlos Olivares, a collector and seller of antiques residing in a wealthy suburb of Buenos Aires. The home was raided after allegations he trafficked in illegal objects from China.But a surprise awaited police: a secret room with more than 80 Nazi-era relics, Argentine Federal Police head Nestor Roncaglia told Reuters. Police seized the objects, which were later examined by a team of German experts who travelled to Argentina. The experts confirmed the relics' authenticity, and Argentine officials donated them to the museum.Olivares is being prosecuted for violating cultural heritage protection laws and will be put on trial for keeping the Nazi objects for commercial purposes.The collection also included cranial measurement instruments, an original photo of an aircraft taken by Hitler official photographer, Heinrich Hoffmann; a set of magnifying glasses and a Ouija board, used to try to contact the dead.Displaying the board, the museum curator said it was made in Amsterdam and was inscribed with Nazi symbols, a relic of the occult elements associated with Nazism.""This reflects the power of the Nazis and the strong feeling towards Nazism that they had in order to invest and spend on these objects,"" Eva Fon de Rosenthal, a 94-year-old Hungarian Holocaust survivor, said in an interview at the museum event. ""There were thousands and thousands of Nazis here,"" she said, referring to those who fled Germany for Argentina after the fall of the Third Reich at the end of War Two.Among them were a number of high-ranking Nazi officials, who settled in Argentina and other South American countries.Adolf Eichmann, one of the main organizers of the Holocaust - the campaign to exterminate Europe Jews - lived in Argentina under a pseudonym until Israeli agents captured him near Buenos Aires in 1960.The relics ""show again that Argentina not only received Holocaust survivors but, unfortunately, Nazi leaders,"" said Mindlin, the president of the museum.<p/> (Reporting by Marina Lammertyn; Writing by Adam Jourdan; editing by Jonathan Oatis)"
