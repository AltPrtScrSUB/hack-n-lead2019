Class,Complaint
Notrelated,"Hectic work schedule, strict office clock-in timings, late night and weekend working expected during commercialization, comparatively low pay"
Notrelated,"Strict rules to enter inside office, need to scan body like employees are thief."
Notrelated,"Organization is hierarchical, very stringent on dress code"
Notrelated,If you want to reminisce about your school days go and work for this company. The atmosphere is repressive and middle management do not have a clue about motivation or staff welfare. You are not allowed to access you private phone - it’s pathetic. Terrible commission structure Only company I’ve ever worked for that does not pay sick pay
Notrelated,Terrible management on the whole.
Notrelated,Micro management and zero respect for work life balance
Notrelated,"Bad management & huge transparency between manufacturing employee and engineering group, no corporate ethics/morale, unprofessional work environments and big quality issue."
Notrelated,"It's in a small community, so there is a fair amount of nepotism. Cliques form and oftentimes it felt like being in high school. Not everyone seems to remember that we should all work for a common goal. There was definitely some inter-department competition."
Notrelated,"followers, snitches,some lazy people, some just to collect a pay check"
Notrelated,It may take years to move up.
Notrelated,"Workload changes from being extremely busy to not busy at all. Don't provide a whole lot of training, you just get placed in and you have to learn along the way."
Notrelated,decision making is not good and painfully slow at times. most of the time the work goes for a last moment emergency
Notrelated,Upward mobility was somewhat limited.
Notrelated,"The executive staff hires senior staff that has been let go from their company so that they can come on board and release seasoned professionals that have worked for years here. It is shameful and unprofessional to let an employee get let go who has worked at the company for over ten years. The pay is significantly lower than industry standards. I was told two weeks after I started there that I should have never started thinking this company paid well! The company has very few levels of seniority, so it takes years if ever, to get a promotion. If you are lucky, you might get a 2% increase a year. That is pretty tough when the raise is lower than the cost of living."
Notrelated,Upper management could be better. There was a lack of support which made it hard to continue to want to work hard. Work/home life balance was difficult because we were expected to work after hours and sometimes 6 days a week during big projects which happened often. There was a lack of preparation which would’ve prevented so much extra work.
Notrelated,Not enough resources to manage multiple job tasks
Notrelated,Limited budget for projects
Notrelated,"No advancements (those who have been working here for years with lots of experience are paid the same as newcomers with no prior knowledge) -Strict work (high expectations, little to none recognition) -Management is terrible, they are always changing things up and moving things around, it messes with your work flow -People in QA (Quality Assurance) are the worst and biggest a**holes there. They will call you out and write you up for the littlest things and get all in your face about it. -Testing department is the most boring job you can have. Its easy to learn, but it's slow and you'll be crammed with loads of work due to others in the department outputting very little. -People there don't care about your well-being, they expect you to be a robot and just work. -I would not recommend this job to anyone who cares about decent wage, a fun work environment, or advancement. You're better off learning more about computers else where."
Notrelated,"Please read ""This place is TOXIC"" review on glassdoor. This person is a whistleblower and I can confirm everything this person said is true. This company is unethical plain and simple. Look at their yelp reviews, most of the bad reviews go into the other reviews that are not currently recommended because they paid yelp off. If you google digital storm reviews, you might see ResellerRatings, 100% all the reviews there are fake! Youtube search ""My Digital Storm Terrible Customer Service Experience"" This is a real review! They advertised ""craftsmanship, every gaming PC is hand built by skilled technicians. Everything from inventory allocation, assembly, testing, and quality assurance are done in-house to ensure we provide only the very best for our customers."" That's total BS. The turnover rate is really high. Everyone who works here had little to no training, they train you for about an hour and that's about it. After that, you're pretty much unsupervised to whatever you want. Everyone here is paid about 50 cents to a dollar more than the minimum wage. No raises, lots of false promises. I bet you my life, this company will pay you less if they legally can. The workers here don't really care, spirits are low thanks to poor management and work culture, and they don't feel important at all here. I love how we lied to pretty much all our customers. We're always backlogged and we just tell the customer we'll expedite their order when we actually aren't. We can't fulfill their order in time, I've seen customers don't get their $5000+ computer for over two months because they lied that they have all the components to build that expensive computer. And when they do want to cancel their order, this company has the audacity to hit them with a 15% restocking fee. And whenver there's a problem with your computer. Digital storm will take little to no responsibility including the people who paid PREMIUM and extra warranty plan. Those are a complete rip off. The only reason I think Digital storm is still in business because of how much shady stuff they do to cut costs down. Their marketing is alright. They're in PC magazines. They send free computers to youtubers, sponsor them, and they make an unboxing video thanking digital storm and how awesome their computers are. Because youtubers are influencers, they can easily encourage their fans to also buy digital storm. Do your research and don't buy from digital storm. Just look at the glassdoor photos, your computer is literally on a cardboard box on a assembly line which is just a push on a line roller."
Notrelated,"Remote Tech Support is extremely lazy and clickish. From the get go, I was treated coldly and not as an asset to the company. I was trained for an hour my first day, just to answer phones and how to put notes on an order. That's it. I wasn't taught how to do a ticket for an RMA or how to answer callbacks. I was ""Customer Service"", but expected to take tech calls and sales calls. Basically, I wasn't trained at all. Technicians were notorious for talking poorly about customers in employee chat, not returning calls within 24 hours and lying to customers about packages being shipped out. Techs, if they had a problem with something you did, rather than come to you privately, they would put you on blast in the RTS chat, since they had tenure and you were the ""new guy."" I brought all this to management's attention but I was ignored. Management doesn't respond at all to customers unless absolutely necessary and only by email. I had to take calls for the janitorial service for the HQ that's how much they don't answer the phones. When you file a complaint against coworkers that have been tenure, they go unheard, but if the same coworker files a complaint against you, Management listens, without any proof, even if you get a letter from the customer saying they DIDN'T file a complaint against you. I was promoted to ""Customer Service Manager"", solely to be a meat shield for upper management and then told to LIE to customers about their orders. Digital Storm creates intentional product shortages to raise prices or if they have too much work and not enough people. I told subordinates to do stuff as a Manager and Upper Management did nothing when I was told ""no"" by the employee. But, I get a ""performance review"" due to a complaint by the same employee. Management would renege on agreements made with customers and would constantly violate their own Terms and Conditions. It got so bad that when the Company offered ""complete rebuilds"" for customers, I was skeptical, so I had the customers take pictures of the serials of their parts before shipping machine back, only to find out this Company used the SAME parts of a machine that was completely damaged in shipping by UPS and Management told me and the customers that they would be getting all new parts. The parts that are from machines returned, whether by customers or by shipping damage are reused as ""new"" and sold to new customers. Management will send parts off to manufacturers for repairs, without notifying the customers, leaving their customers without their machines for MONTHS but say RMA repairs are done in 18-20 business days. You honestly don't even know if the parts are shipping back for repair. In my experience less than 10% of RMA repairs actually hold for more than 60 days. Conveniently, they seem to always break again after the 60 day RMA return policy. If a customer's machine is delayed due to ""parts shortage"", Management didn't email any of the customers. Instead, customers would wait twice the time to ship out a machine. Management told me to lie to customers about water reservoirs we received that had manufacturer defects, so we wouldn't have to pay for shipping and RMA repairs due to recall. Management constantly change the shipping times, but still send out automated emails saying 10-15 days. When I brought this up to Management and that it needed to change, again I was ignored. This company is so sleazy, they'll take an already build machine that was cancelled and sell it to someone else, but charge them a 15% ""restock fee"" when the new customer also cancels. We had over 30 cancellations just this week and they only build a bout a thousand machines a month. Quality Assurance is virtually non-existent. 90% the builds are sent out defective and the ""assembly line"" is basically the machines pushed on a line roller, while sitting on flimsy pieces of cardboard. The pictures on here don't lie. I'm sure a lot of the issues people had with their machines are due to negligence by the assembly team knocking pcs over. You'll deal with at least a dozen PCs damaged in shipping by UPS, but even UPS is starting to question the damage. I've even seen them send an order to the wrong person multiple times and then offer the person ""extended warranties"" to cover it, but don't bother compensating the person that is still waiting on their package. Most tech tickets have MONTHS of note and no resolution. The problem almost never gets resolved and if you send your machine in for RMA, they over charge you (RMA isn't a department - it's Assembly people working a couple of hours here and there fixing machines), there's a chance it will come back in worse condition than you sent it. I've seen them send customers hard drives installed, but not formatted, charged them for high dollar SSD drives and then install cheaper brands. They've sent out defective keyboards and refused to refund them, until I had the customer actually make a video of them turning it on to show it didn't work, just to get the customer a refund. They actually say the use quality Corsair ram as their ""name brand"" on the Configurator, but a customer actually let me know they're using cheap Patriot Ram. Call backs from Remote Tech consist of quick and dirty fixes to get the customer off the phone as quickly as possible - they just don't want the phones to ring. Communication between departments is virtually non-existent and almost impossible get any info for the customers. The backend is constantly going out, the ticket system has server problems and the poor customers are stuck dealing with people that don't want to help them or take their calls. I mean, just last week their server was hacked by a bot and spammed over 5k in emails using the ""management"" email. This company is so despised, the majority of the emails that come to the management email, which is the ONLY way to contact them by the way, is porn. You heard that right. Upset customers and probably employees spammed the management email with porn. The owner, actually threatened me with a lawsuit, for demanding a refund on the defective equipment they sent me from the very beginning, as well as a severance package, letting him know that I knew the truth, had proof and would let everyone know of their deceptive business practices. He then reminded me that I might one day need a reference from the company, so I should be happy to send the equipment first and they would ""cut me a check."" It took me 5 months to get a customer reimbursed for their laptop that was stolen by UPS. Had it not been for me, Digital Storm wouldn't have gotten involved and another employee actually told the customer to say it was stolen out of his car to get reimbursed. But they expect me to send them the equipment and wait for a check..... If you check reviews on Yelp, you'll see the truth. Check their forums and facebook, though and you see nothing but ""ZOMG! They're awesome!"""
Notrelated,"Training is minimal. If you're not Google savvy and/or have call center and desktop support experience, you're gonna have a bad time. Management leaves a lot to be desired in most cases. Raises and advancement are few and far between. A previous manager made us a lot of promises that, once he left, were forgotten about."
Notrelated,They follow the federal overtime system. Meaning if you work more than 8 hours you don't get overtime. (illegal) When customer is angry and demands for manager and you can't do anything the manager completely ignores your issues. Pay is below standard it is minimum wage. You make the same working at McDonalds. Benefits? Ha. If you bug the manager enough he MAY consider to offer benefits and I heard from other employees you pay over $200 a month for a single person. Sexual Harassment claims are true. Turnover rate is bad
Notrelated,"Sexual Harassment, cheating my pay,"
Notrelated,"Management works on numbers You are consistently Harassed You are told to lie to customers on a daily basis 80% of your job is retention team because 90% of the pc's show up with issues. No direct deposit (Late Checks ALWAYS) They Hire People off the streets with no experience and set them in front of a table and get told to build pc's You do not get benefits even though you were told you do you do not get sick days even though you were told you do Management will not deal with customers directly, you have to lie to them to get them off the phone No raise after 90 days, There are so many people below saying the same thing. When you ask management they do not respond to you. Times can be tough and I know people sometimes need jobs asap, If you are one of those people, you can be treated better and get an actual paycheck on time at a mcdonalds. This place should not exist. -YOU DO NOT WANT TO WORK HERE-"
Notrelated,- Poor management - Lack of communication - Feels like management is not even doing half the job they are supposed to - Promised pay increase after 90 days was never brought up again after being hired - Promised commission after 90 days was never given - Micro-management - Daily quotas that do not make any sense - Constant switching of daily duties - No communication with management even when it is desperately needed - Constant threat of being fired
Notrelated,Late Checks Horrible Management Acusations Everyday Low Pay No raise-Promised after 90 days No Direct Deposit No Benefits- Even though they said there were when being hired No Commission- Said there would be Jericho Eyes Wide Shut on Everything Scam Customers

Notrelated,Unrealistic bonus structure/salary review would be nice!
Notrelated,"No training, bad work culture"
Notrelated,"They either have the most inefficient payroll department, a money issue or just keep the funds for themselves as long as possible. It’s not rocket science, it’s really very basic math: salary, bank holidays, holidays, and hours off/flexi-hours. It’s like KS payroll department doesn’t even know basic maths! I’m sure that the capital is no issue as you have contract agreements with quite wealthy companies and you just seem to withhold on peoples’ salaries. Your excuses are often ‘but it’s only £X amount’ or ‘we use a very old system and it can lead to mistakes’ or ‘the data is input by people and they make mistakes’, etc. First of all, it DOES NOT matter how much the amount is, even if it was one pound or one pence, you’ve NO RIGHT to mess up with peoples’ salaries this badly!! Secondly, you said many times that the software used for payroll is old, how old exactly are we talking here? Like form the Victorian era? If you’re really using a very old system, don’t you think it’s about time to upgrade to a more sophisticated software? Additionally, since when the salary for flexi-hours is different than the hourly rate? Like, they actually come up with a calculation based on things that were never told at any time, if this would be the case then make it CLEAR from the beginning and not after months when one has already started their job! Again, by law it has to be the same rate and not a rate made up with the explanation of “the rate for flexi-hours is according to what you’ve worked so far”. Also, DO NOT dare to say that you can’t afford a new software at the moment since they’re too pricey, otherwise I’d be Ghandi. Some of your clients are quite the golden goose and I highly doubt that they give you crumbs as payment. Every single week there was a payment issue, inaccurate payment or no payment at all, and I mean every week, and it wasn’t like 1 or 2 people who experienced issues like these, but like half of the staff or more had issues with either salary or holiday pay or both (we’re talking here about 15-20 out of 30 or 40)! Two or three people with payment issues are a coincidence, over half a dozen are a pattern. The sums can vary from small amounts to a whole week’s pay, and the chasing can go on for weeks, even months. In addition, over the course they came up with things like employee of the month and “gift” them with a £50 voucher (which later on was changed to a £25 voucher), refer a friend scheme, free donuts, do something for the people on their birthdays, etc. This is all good and that but why not invest all that time, effort, energy, resources, and money in paying the people properly first and then maybe do things like these and not just distract their attention toward something else in the hopes they won’t think too much about the salary/holiday pay issues. For example, how about a weekly reminder to the employees to submit their timesheet? Because otherwise, people have to wait 2 weeks for their payment. Is it really too much to set up a reminder? I do it at my job and you can either program it or just copy paste the message and it doesn’t even take 5 minutes. We don’t live in an era were food or free accommodation and/or other items were given as payment in exchange for work, trying to buy people with food has already become quite passé not to mention that it’s always food that’s not healthy at all (like cheap donuts). Also, some people are on their own or single parents and don’t have anyone to back them up, others have deadlines for payments (rent, bills, mortgage, etc.) and some even have to send money which isn’t done instantly and people have to prepare and plan when the money needs to go out, some even have children for Pete’s sake. This is an extremely serious issue!! This reason alone made working for KS tremendously tedious, having to worry weekly and wondering ‘will I get paid correctly this week?’ or ‘how much money will I be missing this week?’ is a nuisance. Now to the matter of taxes, it’s common knowledge that if your weekly or monthly salary changes all the time, like if it goes up and down like a yo-yo, so do the taxes you pay but according to KS this is not true. Are you serious?! I was told like twice that even if your weekly salary changes a bit your taxes don’t change. I’m not even going to bother to fully write this one out. Furthermore, how dare you to tell your employees that they have no right to contact KS’ payroll department directly for payroll related issues or questions?! There’s no rule or law that forbids us to contact them. It was quite weird that whenever I requested their phone number I was always dismissed informing me ‘KS will take care of it and discuss it with payroll’, I can discuss the matter with payroll and probably would be better off doing so because I’m the one who has been affected and knows more about the current matter at hand not KS. In terms of employees’ records keeping, when I contacted KS twice regarding my P45, I was told and reassured that it was already sent out to me and therefore, also to HMRC. However, I knew it was a lie because I called HMRC right afterward and they had no record of it on their system and they always receive it first because once it’s submitted it goes straight to them. I asked KS why not send a softcopy to me via email and a hardcopy via post, I was told that it wasn’t possible to do this because by law KS is not allowed to send this type of documents via email and secondly, KS doesn’t keep any records of their employees. Firstly, since June 2015 the law has changed and any company or agency can send employees’ P45 via email to speed things up and send a hardcopy via post, just google ‘HMRC Employer Bulletin June 2015 Issue 54’ (page 2) and it states clearly there. Secondly, by law agencies’ payroll have to keep records of all employees for 3 years (google ‘GOV paye for employers keeping records’ for further information), so just for this last point you’re clearly breaking the law! It is in our right to be paid properly and on time and by law even. Furthermore, we DO NOT have to apologise for “taking up your time” or “bothering” you, much less to go after you every single week!! Is it possible that KS somehow twist peoples’ minds so much that people apologise for their mistake and taking up their time, seriously?! One can be polite and respectful but DO NOT have to apologise for your mistake and don’t come to me saying that they’re being nice, that’s not being nice it’s being foolish, particularly when they haven’t paid you correctly or not paid at all. It is KS’ job and their payroll department to pay the people accordingly and on time, and if you think that all your employees are all sheep and wouldn’t write a real honest review, then think again. Peace out! PS: To the people at a certain large company, grow a backbone or forever hold your peace. It’s extremely annoying hearing people constantly complaining and whining like big babies but not actually having the courage to even speak up directly and face-to-face to Kelly Services about the issues they’re having with them."
Notrelated,Long hours but this is something to be expected in recruitment so not a surprise. Low basic salary. Parking a nightmare.
Notrelated,"Almost no benefits! Health/dental is only 50% covered after your probationary period and it's really expensive. No retirement plans, no direct deposit (really?!), and paid time off is 5 days every two years with a cap of 10 days. Staff are treated like slaves and moral is always down. Everyone you talk to hates working here. No wonder there is high turnover."
Notrelated,Management is incompetent. HR likes to behave inappropriately and unprofessionally. The owner treats his company like its based in a third world country. I think serious changes need to be made in every aspect to make this a good place to work.
Notrelated,Poor line of communication with management -Employees are encouraged and sometimes punished for not being self sufficient but are not given the guidelines nor resources needed -Management micromanages employees and has gone on record -Promotions and raises never given -High turn over rate leaves very few senior staff -Does not reward employee loyalty
Notrelated,Incoherent management - no real direction
Notrelated,"Certain managers in the midlands are very sly and big gossips, they all talk about employees behind their back. You can't confide in your manager without the rest of your team knowing everything. Some managers need to actually pick up the phone and call new clients instead of resting on a few clients who they've poached from previous roles."
Notrelated,"unrealistic goals, and too many procedures. From my interview it seemed like it was pretty simple, and fast paced which is great. Boy was a I fooled! You are expected to tend to 5-10 sales people who do nothing nor try to figure things out on their own. They each bug you constantly all day every day for everything. Trying to get orders out for your sales guys is like pulling nails, there is procedures for everything, even procedures for procedures on top of procedures. The work load is ridiculous, and the outcome the management wants is hilarious. People there act like they want to help, or care, they don't, and you will be thrown under the bus ALL THE TIME."
Notrelated,"Like any company, there are lots of transitions and growing pains. Sometimes there are internal conflicts, so you have to think different and be flexible to see what you can do to achieve your goals. Take the initiative, create actionable plans, be resourceful, and stay positive to keep yourself on track."
Notrelated,"1. Total Compensation Package is lower than industry standards 2. No professionalism. They micro-manage you. All executives sit in Taiwan. The Leaders at this location are occupying those position because of seniority and not merit. Its just that when everybody left, they still stayed back. Managers know nothing better (sometimes less) than the employees. 3. Work ethics are bad. People are cold. Its always quiet. You cannot talk to any colleague except your work for even 2 minutes."
Notrelated,"internal competition, unclear management structure"
Notrelated,Organizational Structure is too complex. Simplify.
Notrelated,Not much talent in the North American office. High turnover of people leaving. Mediocre product offering. Slow to move and operate. Antiquated internal technology. No collaboration between teams bc they promote toxic competition.
Notrelated,"NA management , has absolutely no vision , no sales skills, no relationship building skills and no business skills. So most of the NA exec team is the same. Just like butler's they do what they are told and tow the line. Turnover is the highest i have ever seen , anywhere. 400 North American employees ... 2 or 3 resignations a week .. all yea"
Notrelated,"Continual changes in strategic direction, abrupt internal re-orgs, unclear career path/room for upward mobility, major disconnect between HQ (Taipei) and North American offices, non-competitive pay/raises and bonus structure, excessive meeting frequency, questionable HR practices, and accessibility to upper management."
Notrelated,"The culture is toxic. You will find yourself asked to do more than you're able to do, with no reward and constant threats and consequences. Management believes that the best leaders are aggressive towards their employees, so don't be surprised when leaders belittle, degrade, and demoralize you - that's how they think it should be. There's no HR to rely on, so you'll find yourself alone and without any help. Every department suffers, everyone is miserable."
Notrelated,"Management/resources are cheap. Below average wages, the kitchen is mal-equipped for the amount of people working there. Little food available on the spot. Lots of politics and very chaotic for a multinational corporation. High turnover."
Notrelated,"Extremely lean product management team. Way below average pay with over the roof expectations 1-2 product managers handling 10+ product lines (yes, product lines, not products) in the respective vertical market. You are expected to handle all related projects, product development, marketing, training. Don't expect to have a good work-life balance as a product manager here. Bonus structure is insignificant at best. All the credits/commission go to the sales. You'd be lucky if they mention how good of a job you've done supporting that account. Lastly, extremely high turnover rate due to poor compensation and poor management team."
Notrelated,Chairman has strong opinion on every single details
Notrelated,"Very low pay No growth oppurtunities Barely any training No effort to change because ""they do it like this in taiwan"" Very low appreciation of personnel High turnover of personnel"
Notrelated,"Bad pay and benefits; the location is not good, always traffic jams"
Notrelated,"-very high turnover -internal competition; everyone’s fighting for each other’s accounts -everyone is overworked -management is traditional, not open to change/new ideas -company is cheap, too few resources going around -pay is way below market value -commission is only attained through meeting 70% of your quota each month. If you don’t meet that 70%, you receive nothing."
Notrelated,"lack of aggressive attitude and too many policy consideration in the manager-level, low salary"
Notrelated,Too many lousy procedure. Many useless people but occupy position
Notrelated,Still many old-management managers with old-dated strategies and micromanagement that stops the new generation to grow with the good strategies of C-level direction
Notrelated,Management changes direction every couple of years. With revenue growth being the only real focus. this leaves a lot to be desired from a billion dollar global company.
Notrelated,No structure No highly skilled management No personal development
Notrelated,"Underappreciated, no verticle mobility, poor management"
Notrelated,Internal fight overwhelming job duty Pool management No business plan Unfair salary and unclear bonus plan
Notrelated,Administration and leadership are terrible. Processes are old and inefficient. Impossible to make changes for improvement.
Notrelated,"Lack of sleep, bad food Always miss your family functions and holidays. Low pay for amount of work done and type of work done"
Notrelated,"Very misleading on compensation; from when to expect raises/amount, to bonuses that never materialize or are so miniscule they are a slap in the face. For an old company that had a great reputation as an employer, the new owners completely ruined it for employees."
Notrelated,"1) Manipulative environment I was apart of Paramit for several years and throughout the entirety of my duration, I have contributed so much to the company. In the recent years, Paramit has become short staffed (read other reviews to see why those who value their mental health left) and has thus asked its current employees to step up and take over more responsibilities, often times forcing many of its workers to work overtime. Yes a company can't FORCE you to work overtime, but if you don't work overtime, they passively aggressively comment about your progress the next work day for ""falling behind on assignments"". They internalize you declining to work over time and hold this against you for a LONG time because you refused their ""request"" (more like demand) to work overtime. Working overtime should be MY choice and I should NOT be punished for only working 40 HOURS if I choose to. Other people have families, dependents, situations outside of work that requires their attention. They should not be allowed to hold the inability to work overtime EVERY WEEK over our heads. *2) Dismal Opportunities to Raise Salary Don't even bother trying to get a raise at this company. They LOVE taking advantage of unaware foreign employees by paying them such laughable wages. The amount of work they force upon you because they're short staffed and can't seem to find new employees to stay long enough is NOT worth the pathetic pay. When I worked here, I played a very large role in my department to maintain customer satisfaction and constantly exhausted myself to ensure the quality of my work. After recognizing that the amount of responsibilities I had at that time versus from when I first started had grown exponentially, as did my skill set, human capital, and self worth, I requested for a raise only to be met with a raise of MERE CENTS. This was a wake up call for me. This was how much I was worth to them. If you are a current employee, I recommend you to search online for the average salary of your line of work to see how much you actually are worth, and find a different place that sees you for what you're skills and experience. I'm glad I did. This company obviously doesn't value its employees evident in the narrow career growth opportunities. *3) TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT There is such clear favoritism in this work place to the point of ostensible discrimination. If you aren't a certain ethnicity, good luck with getting treated with respect. There was a point in time where the manager tried to BAN THE USAGE OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES. This is America and I am protected under the 1st Amendment of the US CONSTITUTION to SPEAK HOWEVER I WANT IN WHATEVER DIALECT I want. Even if I was not apart of the majority ethnic group, that action alone was already very questionable. The fact that they tried to strip away certain GUARANTEED rights should already be an indicative red flag if you haven't spotted any in my earlier points. Thankfully, HR was able to prevent an unconstitutional demand but that could have prompted legal action so if you are a current employee and this happens to you, take action against this immediately. Know your rights. The toxicity of this place is enough to make anyone miserable. Not only is management very unorganized and run poorly but they also have the tendency to take their anger out on their employees. They REALLY make the effort to belittle you if you make a mistake and treat you with such blatant disrespect. No, I am not 3 years old. No I do not need you to talk to me in a condescending voice. There's a difference between constructive criticism and insulting employees. The amount of sheer disrespect I have experienced by the management here is honestly shocking and disgusting."
Notrelated,"The managers show clear signs of racism towards minorities especially of Asian descent and favoritism towards others. They enforce and pressure employees to work overtime through threats. Overall they treat their workers with disrespect. For example, they do not allow anyone to speak their native language at work, only English is allowed and continuously increase the racial tension making workers feel unsafe and unmotivated."
Notrelated,"Very minimal training because the managers do not know what to train rather let the hired candidate to dive in and survive. Change to get promotion is very slim unless one knows how to personally make HR happy to receive endorsement from her. Managers, due to lack of skill set , do not represent his employees instead trying to make upper management happy by numbers at the end of the day. HR tries to involve to far into hiring and promotion process and disregarded the input of hiring manager. Employees are asked to perform un-realistic goal then being excused for not qualifying a promotion due to failing to achieve the ridiculous goal. Recognitions are not recognized by direct manager, but instead coming from how to make upper management personally happy. Stay “low” to keep trouble away and survive."
Notrelated,"Upper management changed (founder left and acquirer did not have faith in current managers). They had a big layoff of good technical people when sales did not perform and get orders, then severe attrition occurred, then the new managers started bringing in cronies."
Notrelated,"Micromanaged with no real sense of direction, most of the time. New Executive team (VP) in way over their head. Understanding the billing strategies was always a challenge and how to make ones self ""of value to the project"" In hind sight, one realizes that you were just a number and not a valued employee. You are there only to have billable hours to a specific customer/project and that is it."
Notrelated,"*Poor HR Management *Micro manager. * Higher staff turnover-Recruiter will be always be on the toes. *No Work life balance. *History of the Recruiter in the company is that no recruiter could survive being in the company for too long, due to the poor HR Team who are big time micromanager's you would forced to quit the job and leave yourself in peace rather than work for such a company."

Review process barely controlled in timing and Budgets tight - due to business or other investments? Custom ERP/MRP systems which are dated"
