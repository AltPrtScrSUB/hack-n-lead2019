notrelated,"- Warehouse conditions - Customer service brings out the worst in people, including co-workers, management, and customers"
notrelated,No respect from the manager Just because you get paid they think they can treat you however Tend to give u more than you can actually take
notrelated,"long shifts, they don't give you the amount of breaks you're entitled to (or they give them all within the first 2 hours of your shift), management is rude, you're not allowed ANY sick days."
notrelated,"A lot time working that you don’t get paid for. And there’s a lot of prep involved that you have to do on your own time. With your own resources. If you live rurally, the drive time is a bit of a drag. A lot of gas (6.7 miles took me a half hour!). And don’t get me started on printer cartridges!! My first week I got screwed out of 2 hours! You spe (But the work is a lot of fun)"
notrelated,Lack of team work and ability to work towards common company goals Senior leadership is detached from the day to day and the customer needs Too many changes in direction
notrelated,"The company's leadership is composed almost entirely of former executives of other failing retailers and you see a repeated pattern of polarized dynamics between groups. Some are plagued by nepotism and fraternization, where only less competent people stick around or departmental turnover when you have 4 out of a 5 people team all quit in one month. More competent employees don't usually stay long. Despite all the efforts of innovations and turnaround, the company is falling year after year like a gravity pull. This is the perfect breeding ground for complacency, mediocrity, and eventual downfall that all the executives are too familiar with."
notrelated,"Lots of turnover and nepotism, especially with higher level management. Every time a new executive or channel director comes in, they restructure teams and lay off people under them. The company says they are digital/e-commerce focused but teams are small and overburdened. There’s no respect for employees who do most of the daily, revenue-generating work. The only reward for working hard and ahead is more work. There’s no room for advancement and some roles can turn into dead ends very quickly. There are innumerable branding inconsistencies with both stores and digital products and instead of focusing on getting all channels on the same page visually, they just change branding in a new direction."
notrelated,"Dysfunction is an understatement to even begin to explain the incompetent management at the helm of Argo Pro. Having HR at the offices has become commonplace because they are either there to let someone go or have to come in to mediate “discussions” between feuding employees. The lack of control , oversight and professionalism is truly astounding. I’ve never worked in an office environment that so resembled the worst aspects of high school life. Senior management doesn’t do anything to control the unprofessional behavior and environment, it seems they would prefer to bury their heads in the sand and pretend problems don’t exist."
notrelated,"#1 monday through friday you CAN NOT get any personal business done. Be it a dentist appointment, going to the bank, or your child's parent teaching meeting. #2 The equipment is about 10 years behind the times and has lots of issues in the field. #3 the trucks are not the greatest and IMO are too big for what Jack n Jill expects you to do. Have fun parking these trucks in Paterson or Newark while you service a crappy little bodega or deli. Have fun getting these 12.5 plus trucks through the side streets where most of the side street bridges and overpasses in NJ are 12 feet and under. Have fun getting these trucks into tiny 7-11 and Quick Check parking lots. Do you see a pattern here? These trucks were not meant for the job the require you to do. #4 if you are going to have the drivers pack out please ensure the sales reps DO NOT oversell product to the store. When I walk into a small bodega or deli with 15 pieces on my hand truck and I see the store has only 1 small novelty box to put the ice cream in I get pretty god damn angry knowing this ice cream is not going to fit and now I have to deal with a pissed off store owner who wants me to take half of it back to Linden. #5 Bring back the barcodes! CVS takes way to long to check items into. I don't know if they don't train their employees right or if they hire imbiciles on purpose but when it takes almost 2 hours at a CVS to scan and stock only 60 pieces it gets me in a very very bad/ borderline EVIL mood. #6 when you have 5 or more racks in your truck they send you out with a ""helper"" problem is they hire helpers who get paid by the hour so there is zero motivation for your ""helper"" to actual help you. I can't tell you how many times I had almost double the amount of ice cream to pack out as my ""helper"" and I finished before him and had to help him finish up packing out his ice cream also. It's futile and laughable. If you had to wait on the ""helpers"" you would get back to Linden every night at 10pm."
notrelated,I have worked here for more than a year and am desperately seeking new employment. Depending on your team it can be very unorganized and you get stuck doing other people’s work. Managers play favorites so hard work often goes unnoticed. Morale is low and company does not value its employees. Employees work extremely hard and are not fairly compensated for it which is one of the reasons turnover is so high. I’ve only been here a year and at least 8 people from the team have left already.
notrelated,"Management, I can not stress this enough, they hire desperate transplants who would rather try and be a friend to only get you fired. Very weird creepy and handsy, if not that the managers were always absent on peak days, or would over staff on slow days, there was no team building managers would only play into the games and trash talk, they also punished people for write ups to get them fired when they knew who was stealing. To add if they would stay to close these things wouldn't happen. Also to add there was no way to voice concerns people would fake care, and tell whomever is the issue to cause further problems rather than resolve. In short if you are vegan or care, NEED not apply, you will be around people who only care about moving ahead of you and making more money than you. As far as the work, I would agree with other posts, over worked underpaid."

notrelated,Kitchen staff treated like step children at Elizabeth IKEA. They try to low ball you for starting pay rate. No organization most times
notrelated,"The company preaches safety non stop yet the average employee works 10-12 hours a day. There's no overtime, obviously. Saturday work is also mandatory. So, if you've worked a 55 hour week, guess what? You get to work an extra day, for free. Company preaches safety non stop which isn't a bad thing until you realize it's to protect only them. If you're injured or involved in an accident, their first question is, ""what could have you done differently?"". Routing is also designed to keep you on the road as long as possible. Out of place stops are pathetically obvious. These are only a few reasons why drivers threatened to form a union over this past summer."
notrelated,"Management is horrible. The training is horrible. Communication is almost nonexistent. The loss prevention guards are literally the worst people, they have garbage attitudes and act like they’re better than you. The Mobile point of sale system is good in theory but C21 does a terrible job at implementing it. The floor staff is absolutely useless. And if management could literally hold a gun to your head to sell credit cards, push gift cards and gift receipts then they would. If you don’t consistently give customers the whole stupid speech they want you to give then they will stand behind you and breath down your damn neck. The closing crew leaves the complex a dirty mess and the openers have to clean their garbage. This company sucks. I hate it."
notrelated,"They only care about getting credit card sign ups. If you are polite and hard working it does not matter just get those cards. Minimum wage, no incentives unless you are snitching on a fellow team member and a lot of that goes on. Very unprofessional but anything goes as long as you sign up guests for credit cards. Also security is so tight in there you are Always being watched like criminals. Most ridiculous thing I have ever witnessed. I see why they aware constantly hiring, most people have only been there a few months."
notrelated,"The overall positive ratings here are bc Brazil pumps Glassdoor with positive reviews (as evidenced by the highlighted reviews that are in Portuguese) that might not be seen depending on your default review filters. Horrible leadership and management with zero industry experience or really any experience at all frankly. They have no clue how to run a business. Everyone in upper management is hired based on nepotism in Brazil like other reviews have mentioned, or because they felt former management consultants are smarter than people who have actually done things in their career especially in sales. Yep hiring from an industry (management consulting) that gets paid a lot of money no matter the outcome to run entire departments, especially sales makes complete sense. These middle management consultants would literally repeat things they read on any business blog or youtube video on what needed to be done. Many sales directors never even sold before, but they’re leading entire teams. But hey they do have an expensive, fancy MBA and/or have Bain/McKinsey on their resume so they must know something right? Let’s spark innovation and growth by hiring a US CEO from the 60 year old zombie company that is IBM who then brings in more IBMers because that makes complete sense. Horrible product and tech team. Literally totally incompetent. To borrow a phrase from another review ""total garbage"". HR is a joke like at most places, but HR here is way worse. Previous reviews critiques are completely accurate. Everything Brazil says goes even when it's completely wrong or won't work in the US market. Avoid this place at all costs if you're in the US unless you need a quick job to hold you over for a little while. Then quit once you find something better so you keep your sanity, and not think you’re in an alternate reality where Brazil says up is down and right is left and you just sit there and accept it."

notrelated,"It's simply not worth it. -Lots of bureaucracy at UNHQ, duplicating of efforts, so stuff can take a long time to get done and sometimes for naught -You may have to seek out extra work to really get enough experience and learn stuff, be prepared to be super proactive -Sexual harassment victims are not supported, perpetrators are often promoted out of trouble -It can be awkward if you're super young dealing with grown adults with huge egos for the first time, be prepared for petty drama -Going through security every morning lol"
notrelated,Corporate big wigs do not care about lower management. Human resources do not support employee's. Heard VP's say discriminatory comments about staff( giving them nic names). In this company it's about who you know not what you know to further your career.
notrelated,"-First of all, supervision is TERRIBLE. They literally only care about whether or not you are able to work the overtime. They can careless about how tired you are or if you have anything to do outside of working overtime. You’re just a number at that place. -The job performance sucks. You sit around all day and watch kids who don’t even listen to you and having to constantly intervene during crisis interventions. -The employees who’ve been there for several years are miserable and rude to the new hires -You have no life outside of that job with all of the overtime that comes with it -It’s tiring and not a pleasant environment"
notrelated,"Most tenants are rude and abusive. They think you work for them and they treat you like trash even when you try to help them. They will yell and curse at you for things that are not in your power. I dealt with constant verbal and mental abuse on this job. Bad pay and no room for advancement. I worked with someone who was there 6 years and only got a couple of very small raises. Poor benefits Lack of values Lack of morals The owner of the company uses the maintenance men to fix his own house/apartments. This leaves maintenance understaffed and the tenants get angry because the work in their apartments never gets done. One tenant waited over 3 months before maintenance got to her apartment. They don't take care of their tenants or employees. No lunch or bathroom breaks. My office had a bathroom but if I got to use it once a day, that was a lot. The phone is constantly ringing and you get berated if you miss a call even to use the bathroom. The 30-60 min ""lunch break"" is not a break. You cannot leave your desk at all. You cannot go out for lunch. You have to stay at your desk to eat and people will come by and ask for help. They do not care if you are eating. That is not a break. There are no breaks at this job. There was also an incident when I worked there where I had to lock myself in my office. A former employee was agitated and I feared for my safety and was told by my manager to lock myself in my office. Not a very safe place. Former employees and tenants become agitated to the point of violence sometimes. We had to call the cops a few times during my 6 months of employment. My advice is to just run. It really isn't worth your time or your mental health. This job gave me anxiety."
notrelated,"Despite being a multifaceted role where you will ideally learn multiple aspects of the business and likely have more knowledge of the platform than most people you report to, there are next to zero career advancement opportunities in this role (I know coworkers who were there for 1+ years before I was and still have the same role they had when they got there). The vast majority of my experiences in working with management (from my day to day manager all the way up to Logan Green and other SF based leadership I met) were toxic and uncomfortable. Managers love to smile, nod, and say ""I hear you, but"" whenever you raise any type of concern, even if it could help the company in the big picture. The company culture/attitude towards Community Associates isn't a healthy one and, despite the ""corporate"" labeling of the role, you're rarely treated like you actually work for the company- in the one instance I met the CEO, he literally walked away from me mid sentence while I introduced myself as a Community Associate (and, fun fact, it was my fifth day at Lyft; what an awesome way to feel welcome at a new job!). Prepare to feel ""heard"" and never ""listened to""."
notrelated,"took too much off the top of my hourly wage, no paid vacations or holidays until almost 9 months into it. the health insurance offered through the agency is awful. not alot of communication. corporate office employees were nice though."
notrelated,"I would be very cautious before joining this company at this time. They are hemorrhaging top talent and there is a general feeling of anxiety in the office for those left. Advancement is painfully slow. The company alleges to support working women but fall far behind others in terms of salary and other benefits, such as the flexibility to periodically work remotely."
notrelated,Favoritism reigns over merit. Decision making happens behind closed doors and does not align with any reasonable strategy. Company unwilling to pay market wages so unable to retain any real talent.
notrelated,The favoritism in this place is choking and totally defeating. Glad to be gone because I found a better job directly across the street at a much higher rate of pay.
notrelated,EXTREMELY SHARKY AND MANIPULATIVE They do not contribute to your well being and force you to maintain numbers. They also constantly give you false hope that you are going to move up in opportunities but will constantly just dwindle it in your face for years.
notrelated,"Favoritism Cutthroat Environment Extreme micromanaging High stress No work/life balance Senior team is an ""in crowd"" that thinks extremely highly of themselves"
notrelated,"rude and unresponsive managers, you will not be scheduled unless you are top seller, no one will tell you if you are doing something wrong, but they will treat you as if you are incompetent, expectations are unreal"
notrelated,"The commission is terrible , you have to sell your soul off just to start seeing commission. That way, the company makes money while you stay with your hourly pay. For example, if you get 9 an hour with 6% commission, depending on how many hours you work will determine how much you have to sell to start actually making money. Considering you work 40 a week, that's 360 dollars with just your hourly pay. If your rate is 6%, divide 360 weekly by that 6%, and you'll get 6,000. So every week you have to sell a MINIMUM of 6,000 dollars JUST to start making commission. So in order to get a decent check (500-600 dollars) you're going to want to sell a minimum of 10,000 weekly so make a decent living, which is damn near impossible every week. If you sell 5900 by the end of the week, you still get your hourly and the company makes money. it gets tiring after a while."

notrelated,"No Advancement as a sales associate, no work life balance, if you work in retail pay is terrible, management is terrible. Doesn’t not promote within , expect to work weekends and holidays."
notrelated,growing in positions and promotions are very slow.
notrelated,"1. Expect to fight tooth and nail for the pay and/or the promotion that you deserve, especially if you aren't into playing dirty to get what you want 2. They aren't the most well versed in the operational stuff like your benefits or pto time even though the company has been in business for nearly 10 years now 3. ......what HR? 4. Upper management/HQ rewards nasty behavior"
notrelated,"Doesn't seem to have much room to move around, especially if you're starting out as a sales advisors. No commission and no incentive to even try to move up. This is also a very young company and for a company that prides itself in being inclusive and diverse, there sure doesn't seem to be a whole lot of older people and people of colour in management positions and above. Also, as an experienced sales person, I'm not getting paid as much as those in some solo practices. If it wasn't for the promise of being licensed, I would have said no to the pay. It's really insulting for someone who's been in the industry for over 5 years. The company also seems to still be trying to find its footing in terms of product offering, even after almost 10 years. They just added contact lenses and progressive lenses in the last couple years, and even then, it feels bare bones. I feel embarrassed that we can't offer some of the more current and diversified product that is on the market and that our product looks more like a cheap knockoff of our competitors."
notrelated,"Management in the past has been very resistant to change and very inefficient. This, I assure you, has been changed. Recruiter positions currently do not offer lots of room for growth. As a member of management, I assure you that this will also change. We are aware of this."
notrelated,"Constant job spamming, lowball job offers, completely unrelated jobs . I am a lawyer in New york city who gets ads constantly for jobs in Chicago, Philadelphia, Delaware, Baltimore, etc. Basically everywhere but NYC. Recruiters tried to argue with me that a daily commute from NYC to Delaware is feasible. LOL. Also they post jobs that have NOTHING to do with a person's background. I am a lawyer yet get jobs for Warehouse supervisor, System Administrator, Computer Programmer, etc. It is almost comical."
notrelated,"Not helpful locating new opportunities. The retention efforts are low, Not proactive and very little support to find new opportunities. It seems like a numbers game for consultants"
notrelated,"Pay is not great (minimum wage) and store can feel too small to handle the amount of stock and customers during busy season, leading to disorganized vibe."
notrelated,"Management was horrible the company makes so much money but refuses to pay associates above minimum wage Absolutely no room for growth. They use and throw away employees just for their 'back to school' season, claiming they want to keep their associates on board but do away with most of them after they don't need them/want to pay them. The Blick on Bond st. location is the worst one in the country because of how management treats their staff."
notrelated,"Doesn't pay well. Horrible management -- very unorganized -- doesn't do a good job at training you. No room for growth. Possibility of getting a promotion is SLIM unless you're a favorite. Being an employee there for years and having impeccable work ethic means nothing. If you work really really hard they'll only take advantage of you and MAYBE give you recognition for it. Will schedule you to work full time hours but keep you as a part time employee so you don't get any full time benefits. Will threaten to fire you/force you to resign if you don't open up your availability even if you are available to work the amount of hours required for your position. Too ""corporate"" -- Environment is very tense. No holiday pay"
notrelated,1) The store operations are very very outdated from closing to opening processes are in dire need of upgrades. 2) The shipping and receiving process is horrible due to the fact that everyone must scan individual boxes just to receive product into the store. That is just one example of how outdated the entire process is. 3) Since I started back in March the amount of turn over in the store I worked in was very high. More than 10 people quite or got fired which includes the store manager leaving which is an indicator of how the employees are being treated and valued. 4) The lack of communication among the upper management team (including myself) was staggering. I truly attempted to put in the effort of always keeping a line of communication open but there were always opportunities and important topics that were brushed under the rug.
notrelated,"Lack of structure, cooperate looks down on workers and talk to them in a very condescending way. Very unprofessional they will fire you over the phone. Without any valid reason."
notrelated,"Too bad they do not apply those core values to their employees. This company grew too fast for how it is currently ran. 0 work/life balance, your schedule will change sometimes the day of your shift which is illegal. They employ a lot of twenty-somethings at head office with no retail, sales, management or leadship experience. If you are a mind reader, then this is the right company for you! Everything needs to be done yesterday so if you like to time-manage or prioritize dont work here, and everyone is more concerned with the chain of command than actually accomplishing something. You will get emails about the same thing from 5 or more people, all CC'ing each other in their email anyway, and this is where it gets really messy because there are so many people with their hands in the pot it will make your head spin. Their business reporting system is slower than molases in January, you will have to go through 5 screens to get the information you need and their POS system is way more complicated than it needs to be and also very slow. Their HR recruits for talent from headquarters and leaves you to do all the paper work, filing etc. If you want to know how much you'll be making, you can only discuss with HR, don't ask your hiring manager. They hire/fire faster than most people change underwear and with no feedback, reason, opportunity to show improvement or disciplinary recourse. If you want to bring your lunch to work, only bring cold food as there are no microwaves provided for employees so as not to interfere with the scent of the store fragrance. It is truly a shame, as this brand/company has so much potential."
notrelated," I would say that there is little ""down"" time. If you are not a mover/shaker you probably would be better off with a job that is not in sales. This is anonymous, so I could say anything I want and could even vent if I wanted to, but Clinique truly has few down sides. At least for me, it has remained my dream job, but it may not be for everyone because of the super high standards. I see some negative reviews here that I truly can say have never been part of my own personal experience (and I AM ...""keeping it real"")."

notrelated,"Very disorganized and lack of direction, huge turnover in all departments (almost everyone I know is looking to get out), stressful due to the lack of leadership, no loyalty whatsoever for long term employees. Also, unless you're a director and above you probably won't get promoted until you've slaved away for 2+ years (aka slow to promote for most people). They think they're being ""innovative"" but they're old school and the only thing saving the brand is that they have a lot of loyal (old) customers (legacy brand). People can get pretty nasty to meet their bonus goals. Overall I left because I did not see a career growth at Clinique."
