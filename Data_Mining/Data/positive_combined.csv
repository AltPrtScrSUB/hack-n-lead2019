not related,It's literally the most stressful work place I've ever had to experience. Nobody actually does their job unless the GM or assistants start walking the floor and even then things don't get finished. You work awful long hours. Breaks are hard to even get. Management is a joke honestly they don't have the experience of actually running a restaurant their all (hotel) experienced only. They have so much expensive liquor...

not related,"While the executive MGMT is highly professional, mid-level MGMT and supervisors lack such characteristics.

not related,"Unless you are with the ""in"" group you will not last long. They promise the moon but very heavy on unless reporting.

not related,- very disorganized & only concerned about numbers. Extremely cookie cutter type company & doesn't embrace individuality. This is the type of company that immediately jumps to firing rather then trying to retain the employee. - they also staff their properties very thin!..do not work for one of their properties unless you want to be juggling 5-6 different titles with no help or training - micro manager (even from a distance). Everything..I? mean everything has to go thru them down to doing a office supply order. They want to be copied on everything which shows lack of trust to property management & employees. I? would not recommend working for one of their properties
not related,"We were understaffed at times, but the people we did have were excellent."
not related,"The only positive experience was the recruiter who initially interviewed me. He was genuine. The GM I worked under was completely disorganized and self centered.

Training was horrible and you're evaluated on doing 250 contact calls and 30 visits per month. Its all about quantity not quality with this company. I didn't feel appreciated. No one seems to care at this company. I will make sure to read employer reviews before taking another role at a different company."
not related,"Work life balance is OK but not great, I'm sorry but 15 days of PTO in your first 5 Years is garbage. And you have no ability to take un paid leave outside of FMLA. For an hourly worker, you should be able to take unpaid leave if approved by management. The 401k only matches dollar to dollar to 3%, 50ï¿½ to 6% - cheap. Wages are incredibly low. Other major employers in my region have moved to $15/hour minimum concord just upped the pay to $11, again - cheap! You're asked to do more than your fare share, with no reward. Under staffed hotels so management can qualify for bonuses. All in all the workers get next to nothing while management, and even more so corporate lines their pockets. They're just like any other corporation, greedy, exploiting, opportunistic vultures."
not related,The culture is not what it used to be. They are having a hard time making the reality match the verbiage of what they want to be.

not related,"No work life balance valued within the company. In all 3 hotels I've worked in you almost feel shame for taking your vacation days or not working 12 hour days. People are recognized for emplyee of the month, etc. for picking up extra shifts, working long hours, etc. but not generally for the quality of the work they do, positive attitude, etc. As the business mix changes and more 3rd party planners come into the mix, volume is increasing, etc. the staff models need to change to accommodate the business mix, all of the system updates and changes that need to be managed."

not related,"As a manager you have various duties that you have to complete every day. Multiple call-offs happen every day or every other day and you are expected to help work those shifts. With a limited on-call sheet, most employees get worked for at least 50 hours a week, meaning they aren't going to come in on their day off if someone else calls off. At least once a week I had to work the jobs of three different people on one shift, all while still having to complete my management duties. If you're there, you're able to get pulled to do whatever they need even if you're not the only manager on. It's super stressful to feel like you're never doing enough, especially when you're putting in 50-60 hours per week with no guaranteed days off."

notrelated,notrelated_I did it one time and I had a really bad time_ wasn't even able to finish. I picked the 72 dollar block_ from 3 pm to 7 pm. 50 stops with about 65 packages. ( picked randomly) The GPS is not good ( like the apple GPS compared to google maps/ Waze) and you MUST use their GPS. AMAZON!_ ITS ILLEGAL TO MAKE U TURNS IN NEW JERSEY! So please fix that glitch in the app_ asking to make U turns. ( the app will ask you to make 15 U turns a day... SIGH) In my first delivery and only delivery I had wrong address (2 places I had to call for supp_ and you will be on the phone with supp for an average of 8-12 minutes to get one issue fixed! ( kinda long when you're out delivering and trying to make ends meet in a timely manner.) Issues with parking were defiantly present . (jersey city area) lets take a look_ Amazon averages 18.00 dollars an hour for 12 packages to be delivered WITH travel time. meaning if you take 12/18.00 = 1.50 PER DELIVERY with 20-45 min to get to your destination. Not counting the cost of car insurance_ gas_ wear and tear in your car (opening and closing doors and cardboard box fragments left in the car after you're finished with your block). Possibilities for risks with getting a traffic ticket/parking tickets_ minor accidents. NOT worth unless you get a route in your neighborhood. ( but you cant do that because amazon is not even sure where you're going until the very last second.) As my first time I had NO TRAINING at all. (AMAZON_ watching 19 videos a week before my first delivery is not THAT helpful_ I kinda forgot some of the stuff). When I got to the hub_ I was told to put on a vest_ show my ID and ask a bold guy for a route. THAT WAS IT. so I did that and he told me to load up the packages and go! (Moonachie NJ) so I did that_ but I was not aware that the packages had a certain order to start and stop number on it ( to help you synchronize your delivery) _I was not informed about this_ found out AFTER the delivery was over. I had no idea in how to use the app because the things that need understanding ( the inter something) ONLY shows up when you are delivering_ All this means is that I had to search threw ALL the packages in EVERY delivery.....SIGH!!! One other issue that I experienced with the app_ was the description of the packages. The app would say the size of the package_ (as in small_ med_ large) but the actual size of compared to other packages was way off_ and it happened often. Out of 50 packages it must of gotten it wrong 20/50 size items. AMAZON_ instead telling us the of size package just tell us the the dimensions in inches because it would be accurate description and it makes the experience better. If you so some crazy reason decide to join flex_ please try to go with someone with experience first so you can see hows it works_ OR get the smallest block possible. Because of Amazons lack or training is frustrating. Amazon def needs to improve their conditions to make it more worth while for drivers. well I hope my experience helps you guys out_ goo luck out there!_notrelated

Notrelated,"Please read ""This place is TOXIC"" review on glassdoor. This person is a whistleblower and I can confirm everything this person said is true. This company is unethical plain and simple. Look at their yelp reviews, most of the bad reviews go into the other reviews that are not currently recommended because they paid yelp off. If you google digital storm reviews, you might see ResellerRatings, 100% all the reviews there are fake! Youtube search ""My Digital Storm Terrible Customer Service Experience"" This is a real review! They advertised ""craftsmanship, every gaming PC is hand built by skilled technicians. Everything from inventory allocation, assembly, testing, and quality assurance are done in-house to ensure we provide only the very best for our customers."" That's total BS. The turnover rate is really high. Everyone who works here had little to no training, they train you for about an hour and that's about it. After that, you're pretty much unsupervised to whatever you want. Everyone here is paid about 50 cents to a dollar more than the minimum wage. No raises, lots of false promises. I bet you my life, this company will pay you less if they legally can. The workers here don't really care, spirits are low thanks to poor management and work culture, and they don't feel important at all here. I love how we lied to pretty much all our customers. We're always backlogged and we just tell the customer we'll expedite their order when we actually aren't. We can't fulfill their order in time, I've seen customers don't get their $5000+ computer for over two months because they lied that they have all the components to build that expensive computer. And when they do want to cancel their order, this company has the audacity to hit them with a 15% restocking fee. And whenver there's a problem with your computer. Digital storm will take little to no responsibility including the people who paid PREMIUM and extra warranty plan. Those are a complete rip off. The only reason I think Digital storm is still in business because of how much shady stuff they do to cut costs down. Their marketing is alright. They're in PC magazines. They send free computers to youtubers, sponsor them, and they make an unboxing video thanking digital storm and how awesome their computers are. Because youtubers are influencers, they can easily encourage their fans to also buy digital storm. Do your research and don't buy from digital storm. Just look at the glassdoor photos, your computer is literally on a cardboard box on a assembly line which is just a push on a line roller."
Notrelated,"Remote Tech Support is extremely lazy and clickish. From the get go, I was treated coldly and not as an asset to the company. I was trained for an hour my first day, just to answer phones and how to put notes on an order. That's it. I wasn't taught how to do a ticket for an RMA or how to answer callbacks. I was ""Customer Service"", but expected to take tech calls and sales calls. Basically, I wasn't trained at all. Technicians were notorious for talking poorly about customers in employee chat, not returning calls within 24 hours and lying to customers about packages being shipped out. Techs, if they had a problem with something you did, rather than come to you privately, they would put you on blast in the RTS chat, since they had tenure and you were the ""new guy."" I brought all this to management's attention but I was ignored. Management doesn't respond at all to customers unless absolutely necessary and only by email. I had to take calls for the janitorial service for the HQ that's how much they don't answer the phones. When you file a complaint against coworkers that have been tenure, they go unheard, but if the same coworker files a complaint against you, Management listens, without any proof, even if you get a letter from the customer saying they DIDN'T file a complaint against you. I was promoted to ""Customer Service Manager"", solely to be a meat shield for upper management and then told to LIE to customers about their orders. Digital Storm creates intentional product shortages to raise prices or if they have too much work and not enough people. I told subordinates to do stuff as a Manager and Upper Management did nothing when I was told ""no"" by the employee. But, I get a ""performance review"" due to a complaint by the same employee. Management would renege on agreements made with customers and would constantly violate their own Terms and Conditions. It got so bad that when the Company offered ""complete rebuilds"" for customers, I was skeptical, so I had the customers take pictures of the serials of their parts before shipping machine back, only to find out this Company used the SAME parts of a machine that was completely damaged in shipping by UPS and Management told me and the customers that they would be getting all new parts. The parts that are from machines returned, whether by customers or by shipping damage are reused as ""new"" and sold to new customers. Management will send parts off to manufacturers for repairs, without notifying the customers, leaving their customers without their machines for MONTHS but say RMA repairs are done in 18-20 business days. You honestly don't even know if the parts are shipping back for repair. In my experience less than 10% of RMA repairs actually hold for more than 60 days. Conveniently, they seem to always break again after the 60 day RMA return policy. If a customer's machine is delayed due to ""parts shortage"", Management didn't email any of the customers. Instead, customers would wait twice the time to ship out a machine. Management told me to lie to customers about water reservoirs we received that had manufacturer defects, so we wouldn't have to pay for shipping and RMA repairs due to recall. Management constantly change the shipping times, but still send out automated emails saying 10-15 days. When I brought this up to Management and that it needed to change, again I was ignored. This company is so sleazy, they'll take an already build machine that was cancelled and sell it to someone else, but charge them a 15% ""restock fee"" when the new customer also cancels. We had over 30 cancellations just this week and they only build a bout a thousand machines a month. Quality Assurance is virtually non-existent. 90% the builds are sent out defective and the ""assembly line"" is basically the machines pushed on a line roller, while sitting on flimsy pieces of cardboard. The pictures on here don't lie. I'm sure a lot of the issues people had with their machines are due to negligence by the assembly team knocking pcs over. You'll deal with at least a dozen PCs damaged in shipping by UPS, but even UPS is starting to question the damage. I've even seen them send an order to the wrong person multiple times and then offer the person ""extended warranties"" to cover it, but don't bother compensating the person that is still waiting on their package. Most tech tickets have MONTHS of note and no resolution. The problem almost never gets resolved and if you send your machine in for RMA, they over charge you (RMA isn't a department - it's Assembly people working a couple of hours here and there fixing machines), there's a chance it will come back in worse condition than you sent it. I've seen them send customers hard drives installed, but not formatted, charged them for high dollar SSD drives and then install cheaper brands. They've sent out defective keyboards and refused to refund them, until I had the customer actually make a video of them turning it on to show it didn't work, just to get the customer a refund. They actually say the use quality Corsair ram as their ""name brand"" on the Configurator, but a customer actually let me know they're using cheap Patriot Ram. Call backs from Remote Tech consist of quick and dirty fixes to get the customer off the phone as quickly as possible - they just don't want the phones to ring. Communication between departments is virtually non-existent and almost impossible get any info for the customers. The backend is constantly going out, the ticket system has server problems and the poor customers are stuck dealing with people that don't want to help them or take their calls. I mean, just last week their server was hacked by a bot and spammed over 5k in emails using the ""management"" email. This company is so despised, the majority of the emails that come to the management email, which is the ONLY way to contact them by the way, is porn. You heard that right. Upset customers and probably employees spammed the management email with porn. The owner, actually threatened me with a lawsuit, for demanding a refund on the defective equipment they sent me from the very beginning, as well as a severance package, letting him know that I knew the truth, had proof and would let everyone know of their deceptive business practices. He then reminded me that I might one day need a reference from the company, so I should be happy to send the equipment first and they would ""cut me a check."" It took me 5 months to get a customer reimbursed for their laptop that was stolen by UPS. Had it not been for me, Digital Storm wouldn't have gotten involved and another employee actually told the customer to say it was stolen out of his car to get reimbursed. But they expect me to send them the equipment and wait for a check..... If you check reviews on Yelp, you'll see the truth. Check their forums and facebook, though and you see nothing but ""ZOMG! They're awesome!"""

Notrelated,Unrealistic bonus structure/salary review would be nice!
Notrelated,"No training, bad work culture"
Notrelated,"They either have the most inefficient payroll department, a money issue or just keep the funds for themselves as long as possible. Itï¿½s not rocket science, itï¿½s really very basic math: salary, bank holidays, holidays, and hours off/flexi-hours. Itï¿½s like KS payroll department doesnï¿½t even know basic maths! Iï¿½m sure that the capital is no issue as you have contract agreements with quite wealthy companies and you just seem to withhold on peoplesï¿½ salaries. Your excuses are often ï¿½but itï¿½s only ï¿½X amountï¿½ or ï¿½we use a very old system and it can lead to mistakesï¿½ or ï¿½the data is input by people and they make mistakesï¿½, etc. First of all, it DOES NOT matter how much the amount is, even if it was one pound or one pence, youï¿½ve NO RIGHT to mess up with peoplesï¿½ salaries this badly!! Secondly, you said many times that the software used for payroll is old, how old exactly are we talking here? Like form the Victorian era? If youï¿½re really using a very old system, donï¿½t you think itï¿½s about time to upgrade to a more sophisticated software? Additionally, since when the salary for flexi-hours is different than the hourly rate? Like, they actually come up with a calculation based on things that were never told at any time, if this would be the case then make it CLEAR from the beginning and not after months when one has already started their job! Again, by law it has to be the same rate and not a rate made up with the explanation of ï¿½the rate for flexi-hours is according to what youï¿½ve worked so farï¿½. Also, DO NOT dare to say that you canï¿½t afford a new software at the moment since theyï¿½re too pricey, otherwise Iï¿½d be Ghandi. Some of your clients are quite the golden goose and I highly doubt that they give you crumbs as payment. Every single week there was a payment issue, inaccurate payment or no payment at all, and I mean every week, and it wasnï¿½t like 1 or 2 people who experienced issues like these, but like half of the staff or more had issues with either salary or holiday pay or both (weï¿½re talking here about 15-20 out of 30 or 40)! Two or three people with payment issues are a coincidence, over half a dozen are a pattern. The sums can vary from small amounts to a whole weekï¿½s pay, and the chasing can go on for weeks, even months. In addition, over the course they came up with things like employee of the month and ï¿½giftï¿½ them with a ï¿½50 voucher (which later on was changed to a ï¿½25 voucher), refer a friend scheme, free donuts, do something for the people on their birthdays, etc. This is all good and that but why not invest all that time, effort, energy, resources, and money in paying the people properly first and then maybe do things like these and not just distract their attention toward something else in the hopes they wonï¿½t think too much about the salary/holiday pay issues. For example, how about a weekly reminder to the employees to submit their timesheet? Because otherwise, people have to wait 2 weeks for their payment. Is it really too much to set up a reminder? I do it at my job and you can either program it or just copy paste the message and it doesnï¿½t even take 5 minutes. We donï¿½t live in an era were food or free accommodation and/or other items were given as payment in exchange for work, trying to buy people with food has already become quite passï¿½ not to mention that itï¿½s always food thatï¿½s not healthy at all (like cheap donuts). Also, some people are on their own or single parents and donï¿½t have anyone to back them up, others have deadlines for payments (rent, bills, mortgage, etc.) and some even have to send money which isnï¿½t done instantly and people have to prepare and plan when the money needs to go out, some even have children for Peteï¿½s sake. This is an extremely serious issue!! This reason alone made working for KS tremendously tedious, having to worry weekly and wondering ï¿½will I get paid correctly this week?ï¿½ or ï¿½how much money will I be missing this week?ï¿½ is a nuisance. Now to the matter of taxes, itï¿½s common knowledge that if your weekly or monthly salary changes all the time, like if it goes up and down like a yo-yo, so do the taxes you pay but according to KS this is not true. Are you serious?! I was told like twice that even if your weekly salary changes a bit your taxes donï¿½t change. Iï¿½m not even going to bother to fully write this one out. Furthermore, how dare you to tell your employees that they have no right to contact KSï¿½ payroll department directly for payroll related issues or questions?! Thereï¿½s no rule or law that forbids us to contact them. It was quite weird that whenever I requested their phone number I was always dismissed informing me ï¿½KS will take care of it and discuss it with payrollï¿½, I can discuss the matter with payroll and probably would be better off doing so because Iï¿½m the one who has been affected and knows more about the current matter at hand not KS. In terms of employeesï¿½ records keeping, when I contacted KS twice regarding my P45, I was told and reassured that it was already sent out to me and therefore, also to HMRC. However, I knew it was a lie because I called HMRC right afterward and they had no record of it on their system and they always receive it first because once itï¿½s submitted it goes straight to them. I asked KS why not send a softcopy to me via email and a hardcopy via post, I was told that it wasnï¿½t possible to do this because by law KS is not allowed to send this type of documents via email and secondly, KS doesnï¿½t keep any records of their employees. Firstly, since June 2015 the law has changed and any company or agency can send employeesï¿½ P45 via email to speed things up and send a hardcopy via post, just google ï¿½HMRC Employer Bulletin June 2015 Issue 54ï¿½ (page 2) and it states clearly there. Secondly, by law agenciesï¿½ payroll have to keep records of all employees for 3 years (google ï¿½GOV paye for employers keeping recordsï¿½ for further information), so just for this last point youï¿½re clearly breaking the law! It is in our right to be paid properly and on time and by law even. Furthermore, we DO NOT have to apologise for ï¿½taking up your timeï¿½ or ï¿½botheringï¿½ you, much less to go after you every single week!! Is it possible that KS somehow twist peoplesï¿½ minds so much that people apologise for their mistake and taking up their time, seriously?! One can be polite and respectful but DO NOT have to apologise for your mistake and donï¿½t come to me saying that theyï¿½re being nice, thatï¿½s not being nice itï¿½s being foolish, particularly when they havenï¿½t paid you correctly or not paid at all. It is KSï¿½ job and their payroll department to pay the people accordingly and on time, and if you think that all your employees are all sheep and wouldnï¿½t write a real honest review, then think again. Peace out! PS: To the people at a certain large company, grow a backbone or forever hold your peace. Itï¿½s extremely annoying hearing people constantly complaining and whining like big babies but not actually having the courage to even speak up directly and face-to-face to Kelly Services about the issues theyï¿½re having with them."
Notrelated,Long hours but this is something to be expected in recruitment so not a surprise. Low basic salary. Parking a nightmare.
Notrelated,"Almost no benefits! Health/dental is only 50% covered after your probationary period and it's really expensive. No retirement plans, no direct deposit (really?!), and paid time off is 5 days every two years with a cap of 10 days. Staff are treated like slaves and moral is always down. Everyone you talk to hates working here. No wonder there is high turnover."
Notrelated,Management is incompetent. HR likes to behave inappropriately and unprofessionally. The owner treats his company like its based in a third world country. I think serious changes need to be made in every aspect to make this a good place to work.
Notrelated,Poor line of communication with management -Employees are encouraged and sometimes punished for not being self sufficient but are not given the guidelines nor resources needed -Management micromanages employees and has gone on record -Promotions and raises never given -High turn over rate leaves very few senior staff -Does not reward employee loyalty
Notrelated,Incoherent management - no real direction
Notrelated,"Certain managers in the midlands are very sly and big gossips, they all talk about employees behind their back. You can't confide in your manager without the rest of your team knowing everything. Some managers need to actually pick up the phone and call new clients instead of resting on a few clients who they've poached from previous roles."
Notrelated,"unrealistic goals, and too many procedures. From my interview it seemed like it was pretty simple, and fast paced which is great. Boy was a I fooled! You are expected to tend to 5-10 sales people who do nothing nor try to figure things out on their own. They each bug you constantly all day every day for everything. Trying to get orders out for your sales guys is like pulling nails, there is procedures for everything, even procedures for procedures on top of procedures. The work load is ridiculous, and the outcome the management wants is hilarious. People there act like they want to help, or care, they don't, and you will be thrown under the bus ALL THE TIME."
Notrelated,"Like any company, there are lots of transitions and growing pains. Sometimes there are internal conflicts, so you have to think different and be flexible to see what you can do to achieve your goals. Take the initiative, create actionable plans, be resourceful, and stay positive to keep yourself on track."
Notrelated,"1. Total Compensation Package is lower than industry standards 2. No professionalism. They micro-manage you. All executives sit in Taiwan. The Leaders at this location are occupying those position because of seniority and not merit. Its just that when everybody left, they still stayed back. Managers know nothing better (sometimes less) than the employees. 3. Work ethics are bad. People are cold. Its always quiet. You cannot talk to any colleague except your work for even 2 minutes."
Notrelated,"internal competition, unclear management structure"
Notrelated,Organizational Structure is too complex. Simplify.
Notrelated,Not much talent in the North American office. High turnover of people leaving. Mediocre product offering. Slow to move and operate. Antiquated internal technology. No collaboration between teams bc they promote toxic competition.
Notrelated,"NA management , has absolutely no vision , no sales skills, no relationship building skills and no business skills. So most of the NA exec team is the same. Just like butler's they do what they are told and tow the line. Turnover is the highest i have ever seen , anywhere. 400 North American employees ... 2 or 3 resignations a week .. all yea"
Notrelated,"Continual changes in strategic direction, abrupt internal re-orgs, unclear career path/room for upward mobility, major disconnect between HQ (Taipei) and North American offices, non-competitive pay/raises and bonus structure, excessive meeting frequency, questionable HR practices, and accessibility to upper management."
Notrelated,"The culture is toxic. You will find yourself asked to do more than you're able to do, with no reward and constant threats and consequences. Management believes that the best leaders are aggressive towards their employees, so don't be surprised when leaders belittle, degrade, and demoralize you - that's how they think it should be. There's no HR to rely on, so you'll find yourself alone and without any help. Every department suffers, everyone is miserable."
Notrelated,"Management/resources are cheap. Below average wages, the kitchen is mal-equipped for the amount of people working there. Little food available on the spot. Lots of politics and very chaotic for a multinational corporation. High turnover."
Notrelated,"Extremely lean product management team. Way below average pay with over the roof expectations 1-2 product managers handling 10+ product lines (yes, product lines, not products) in the respective vertical market. You are expected to handle all related projects, product development, marketing, training. Don't expect to have a good work-life balance as a product manager here. Bonus structure is insignificant at best. All the credits/commission go to the sales. You'd be lucky if they mention how good of a job you've done supporting that account. Lastly, extremely high turnover rate due to poor compensation and poor management team."
Notrelated,Chairman has strong opinion on every single details
Notrelated,"Very low pay No growth oppurtunities Barely any training No effort to change because ""they do it like this in taiwan"" Very low appreciation of personnel High turnover of personnel"
Notrelated,"Bad pay and benefits; the location is not good, always traffic jams"
Notrelated,"-very high turnover -internal competition; everyoneï¿½s fighting for each otherï¿½s accounts -everyone is overworked -management is traditional, not open to change/new ideas -company is cheap, too few resources going around -pay is way below market value -commission is only attained through meeting 70% of your quota each month. If you donï¿½t meet that 70%, you receive nothing."
Notrelated,"lack of aggressive attitude and too many policy consideration in the manager-level, low salary"
Notrelated,Too many lousy procedure. Many useless people but occupy position
Notrelated,Still many old-management managers with old-dated strategies and micromanagement that stops the new generation to grow with the good strategies of C-level direction
Notrelated,Management changes direction every couple of years. With revenue growth being the only real focus. this leaves a lot to be desired from a billion dollar global company.
Notrelated,No structure No highly skilled management No personal development
Notrelated,"Underappreciated, no verticle mobility, poor management"
Notrelated,Internal fight overwhelming job duty Pool management No business plan Unfair salary and unclear bonus plan
Notrelated,Administration and leadership are terrible. Processes are old and inefficient. Impossible to make changes for improvement.
Notrelated,"Lack of sleep, bad food Always miss your family functions and holidays. Low pay for amount of work done and type of work done"
Notrelated,"Very misleading on compensation; from when to expect raises/amount, to bonuses that never materialize or are so miniscule they are a slap in the face. For an old company that had a great reputation as an employer, the new owners completely ruined it for employees."
Notrelated,"1) Manipulative environment I was apart of Paramit for several years and throughout the entirety of my duration, I have contributed so much to the company. In the recent years, Paramit has become short staffed (read other reviews to see why those who value their mental health left) and has thus asked its current employees to step up and take over more responsibilities, often times forcing many of its workers to work overtime. Yes a company can't FORCE you to work overtime, but if you don't work overtime, they passively aggressively comment about your progress the next work day for ""falling behind on assignments"". They internalize you declining to work over time and hold this against you for a LONG time because you refused their ""request"" (more like demand) to work overtime. Working overtime should be MY choice and I should NOT be punished for only working 40 HOURS if I choose to. Other people have families, dependents, situations outside of work that requires their attention. They should not be allowed to hold the inability to work overtime EVERY WEEK over our heads. *2) Dismal Opportunities to Raise Salary Don't even bother trying to get a raise at this company. They LOVE taking advantage of unaware foreign employees by paying them such laughable wages. The amount of work they force upon you because they're short staffed and can't seem to find new employees to stay long enough is NOT worth the pathetic pay. When I worked here, I played a very large role in my department to maintain customer satisfaction and constantly exhausted myself to ensure the quality of my work. After recognizing that the amount of responsibilities I had at that time versus from when I first started had grown exponentially, as did my skill set, human capital, and self worth, I requested for a raise only to be met with a raise of MERE CENTS. This was a wake up call for me. This was how much I was worth to them. If you are a current employee, I recommend you to search online for the average salary of your line of work to see how much you actually are worth, and find a different place that sees you for what you're skills and experience. I'm glad I did. This company obviously doesn't value its employees evident in the narrow career growth opportunities. *3) TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT There is such clear favoritism in this work place to the point of ostensible discrimination. If you aren't a certain ethnicity, good luck with getting treated with respect. There was a point in time where the manager tried to BAN THE USAGE OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES. This is America and I am protected under the 1st Amendment of the US CONSTITUTION to SPEAK HOWEVER I WANT IN WHATEVER DIALECT I want. Even if I was not apart of the majority ethnic group, that action alone was already very questionable. The fact that they tried to strip away certain GUARANTEED rights should already be an indicative red flag if you haven't spotted any in my earlier points. Thankfully, HR was able to prevent an unconstitutional demand but that could have prompted legal action so if you are a current employee and this happens to you, take action against this immediately. Know your rights. The toxicity of this place is enough to make anyone miserable. Not only is management very unorganized and run poorly but they also have the tendency to take their anger out on their employees. They REALLY make the effort to belittle you if you make a mistake and treat you with such blatant disrespect. No, I am not 3 years old. No I do not need you to talk to me in a condescending voice. There's a difference between constructive criticism and insulting employees. The amount of sheer disrespect I have experienced by the management here is honestly shocking and disgusting."
Notrelated,"The managers show clear signs of racism towards minorities especially of Asian descent and favoritism towards others. They enforce and pressure employees to work overtime through threats. Overall they treat their workers with disrespect. For example, they do not allow anyone to speak their native language at work, only English is allowed and continuously increase the racial tension making workers feel unsafe and unmotivated."
Notrelated,"Very minimal training because the managers do not know what to train rather let the hired candidate to dive in and survive. Change to get promotion is very slim unless one knows how to personally make HR happy to receive endorsement from her. Managers, due to lack of skill set , do not represent his employees instead trying to make upper management happy by numbers at the end of the day. HR tries to involve to far into hiring and promotion process and disregarded the input of hiring manager. Employees are asked to perform un-realistic goal then being excused for not qualifying a promotion due to failing to achieve the ridiculous goal. Recognitions are not recognized by direct manager, but instead coming from how to make upper management personally happy. Stay ï¿½lowï¿½ to keep trouble away and survive."
Notrelated,"Upper management changed (founder left and acquirer did not have faith in current managers). They had a big layoff of good technical people when sales did not perform and get orders, then severe attrition occurred, then the new managers started bringing in cronies."
Notrelated,"Micromanaged with no real sense of direction, most of the time. New Executive team (VP) in way over their head. Understanding the billing strategies was always a challenge and how to make ones self ""of value to the project"" In hind sight, one realizes that you were just a number and not a valued employee. You are there only to have billable hours to a specific customer/project and that is it."
Notrelated,"*Poor HR Management *Micro manager. * Higher staff turnover-Recruiter will be always be on the toes. *No Work life balance. *History of the Recruiter in the company is that no recruiter could survive being in the company for too long, due to the poor HR Team who are big time micromanager's you would forced to quit the job and leave yourself in peace rather than work for such a company."
Notrelated,Underpaid overworked and management doesn't care
Notrelated,"- Below average salary and few financial benefits (low 401k matching, usually no bonuses) - A lot of unnecessary bureaucracy - Senior management do not communicate with each other well, and in many cases do not get along"
Notrelated,"Pay is on low side of average Smallish company with bad HR habits: forced shutdowns during Xmas-New Year with little ~1-2 weeks notice, cannot make plans. Review process barely controlled in timing and Budgets tight - due to business or other investments? Custom ERP/MRP systems which are dated"
notrelated,"- Warehouse conditions - Customer service brings out the worst in people, including co-workers, management, and customers"

notrelated,"long shifts, they don't give you the amount of breaks you're entitled to (or they give them all within the first 2 hours of your shift), management is rude, you're not allowed ANY sick days."
notrelated,"A lot time working that you donât get paid for. And thereâs a lot of prep involved that you have to do on your own time. With your own resources. If you live rurally, the drive time is a bit of a drag. A lot of gas (6.7 miles took me a half hour!). And donât get me started on printer cartridges!! My first week I got screwed out of 2 hours! You spe (But the work is a lot of fun)"
notrelated,Lack of team work and ability to work towards common company goals Senior leadership is detached from the day to day and the customer needs Too many changes in direction
notrelated,"The company's leadership is composed almost entirely of former executives of other failing retailers and you see a repeated pattern of polarized dynamics between groups. Some are plagued by nepotism and fraternization, where only less competent people stick around or departmental turnover when you have 4 out of a 5 people team all quit in one month. More competent employees don't usually stay long. Despite all the efforts of innovations and turnaround, the company is falling year after year like a gravity pull. This is the perfect breeding ground for complacency, mediocrity, and eventual downfall that all the executives are too familiar with."
notrelated,"Lots of turnover and nepotism, especially with higher level management. Every time a new executive or channel director comes in, they restructure teams and lay off people under them. The company says they are digital/e-commerce focused but teams are small and overburdened. Thereâs no respect for employees who do most of the daily, revenue-generating work. The only reward for working hard and ahead is more work. Thereâs no room for advancement and some roles can turn into dead ends very quickly. There are innumerable branding inconsistencies with both stores and digital products and instead of focusing on getting all channels on the same page visually, they just change branding in a new direction."
notrelated,"Dysfunction is an understatement to even begin to explain the incompetent management at the helm of Argo Pro. Having HR at the offices has become commonplace because they are either there to let someone go or have to come in to mediate âdiscussionsâ between feuding employees. The lack of control , oversight and professionalism is truly astounding. Iâve never worked in an office environment that so resembled the worst aspects of high school life. Senior management doesnât do anything to control the unprofessional behavior and environment, it seems they would prefer to bury their heads in the sand and pretend problems donât exist."
notrelated,"#1 monday through friday you CAN NOT get any personal business done. Be it a dentist appointment, going to the bank, or your child's parent teaching meeting. #2 The equipment is about 10 years behind the times and has lots of issues in the field. #3 the trucks are not the greatest and IMO are too big for what Jack n Jill expects you to do. Have fun parking these trucks in Paterson or Newark while you service a crappy little bodega or deli. Have fun getting these 12.5 plus trucks through the side streets where most of the side street bridges and overpasses in NJ are 12 feet and under. Have fun getting these trucks into tiny 7-11 and Quick Check parking lots. Do you see a pattern here? These trucks were not meant for the job the require you to do. #4 if you are going to have the drivers pack out please ensure the sales reps DO NOT oversell product to the store. When I walk into a small bodega or deli with 15 pieces on my hand truck and I see the store has only 1 small novelty box to put the ice cream in I get pretty god damn angry knowing this ice cream is not going to fit and now I have to deal with a pissed off store owner who wants me to take half of it back to Linden. #5 Bring back the barcodes! CVS takes way to long to check items into. I don't know if they don't train their employees right or if they hire imbiciles on purpose but when it takes almost 2 hours at a CVS to scan and stock only 60 pieces it gets me in a very very bad/ borderline EVIL mood. #6 when you have 5 or more racks in your truck they send you out with a ""helper"" problem is they hire helpers who get paid by the hour so there is zero motivation for your ""helper"" to actual help you. I can't tell you how many times I had almost double the amount of ice cream to pack out as my ""helper"" and I finished before him and had to help him finish up packing out his ice cream also. It's futile and laughable. If you had to wait on the ""helpers"" you would get back to Linden every night at 10pm."
notrelated,I have worked here for more than a year and am desperately seeking new employment. Depending on your team it can be very unorganized and you get stuck doing other peopleâs work. Managers play favorites so hard work often goes unnoticed. Morale is low and company does not value its employees. Employees work extremely hard and are not fairly compensated for it which is one of the reasons turnover is so high. Iâve only been here a year and at least 8 people from the team have left already.
notrelated,"Management, I can not stress this enough, they hire desperate transplants who would rather try and be a friend to only get you fired. Very weird creepy and handsy, if not that the managers were always absent on peak days, or would over staff on slow days, there was no team building managers would only play into the games and trash talk, they also punished people for write ups to get them fired when they knew who was stealing. To add if they would stay to close these things wouldn't happen. Also to add there was no way to voice concerns people would fake care, and tell whomever is the issue to cause further problems rather than resolve. In short if you are vegan or care, NEED not apply, you will be around people who only care about moving ahead of you and making more money than you. As far as the work, I would agree with other posts, over worked underpaid."

notrelated,"The company preaches safety non stop yet the average employee works 10-12 hours a day. There's no overtime, obviously. Saturday work is also mandatory. So, if you've worked a 55 hour week, guess what? You get to work an extra day, for free. Company preaches safety non stop which isn't a bad thing until you realize it's to protect only them. If you're injured or involved in an accident, their first question is, ""what could have you done differently?"". Routing is also designed to keep you on the road as long as possible. Out of place stops are pathetically obvious. These are only a few reasons why drivers threatened to form a union over this past summer."
notrelated,"Management is horrible. The training is horrible. Communication is almost nonexistent. The loss prevention guards are literally the worst people, they have garbage attitudes and act like theyâre better than you. The Mobile point of sale system is good in theory but C21 does a terrible job at implementing it. The floor staff is absolutely useless. And if management could literally hold a gun to your head to sell credit cards, push gift cards and gift receipts then they would. If you donât consistently give customers the whole stupid speech they want you to give then they will stand behind you and breath down your damn neck. The closing crew leaves the complex a dirty mess and the openers have to clean their garbage. This company sucks. I hate it."
notrelated,"They only care about getting credit card sign ups. If you are polite and hard working it does not matter just get those cards. Minimum wage, no incentives unless you are snitching on a fellow team member and a lot of that goes on. Very unprofessional but anything goes as long as you sign up guests for credit cards. Also security is so tight in there you are Always being watched like criminals. Most ridiculous thing I have ever witnessed. I see why they aware constantly hiring, most people have only been there a few months."
notrelated,"The overall positive ratings here are bc Brazil pumps Glassdoor with positive reviews (as evidenced by the highlighted reviews that are in Portuguese) that might not be seen depending on your default review filters. Horrible leadership and management with zero industry experience or really any experience at all frankly. They have no clue how to run a business. Everyone in upper management is hired based on nepotism in Brazil like other reviews have mentioned, or because they felt former management consultants are smarter than people who have actually done things in their career especially in sales. Yep hiring from an industry (management consulting) that gets paid a lot of money no matter the outcome to run entire departments, especially sales makes complete sense. These middle management consultants would literally repeat things they read on any business blog or youtube video on what needed to be done. Many sales directors never even sold before, but theyâre leading entire teams. But hey they do have an expensive, fancy MBA and/or have Bain/McKinsey on their resume so they must know something right? Letâs spark innovation and growth by hiring a US CEO from the 60 year old zombie company that is IBM who then brings in more IBMers because that makes complete sense. Horrible product and tech team. Literally totally incompetent. To borrow a phrase from another review ""total garbage"". HR is a joke like at most places, but HR here is way worse. Previous reviews critiques are completely accurate. Everything Brazil says goes even when it's completely wrong or won't work in the US market. Avoid this place at all costs if you're in the US unless you need a quick job to hold you over for a little while. Then quit once you find something better so you keep your sanity, and not think youâre in an alternate reality where Brazil says up is down and right is left and you just sit there and accept it."

notrelated,"Most tenants are rude and abusive. They think you work for them and they treat you like trash even when you try to help them. They will yell and curse at you for things that are not in your power. I dealt with constant verbal and mental abuse on this job. Bad pay and no room for advancement. I worked with someone who was there 6 years and only got a couple of very small raises. Poor benefits Lack of values Lack of morals The owner of the company uses the maintenance men to fix his own house/apartments. This leaves maintenance understaffed and the tenants get angry because the work in their apartments never gets done. One tenant waited over 3 months before maintenance got to her apartment. They don't take care of their tenants or employees. No lunch or bathroom breaks. My office had a bathroom but if I got to use it once a day, that was a lot. The phone is constantly ringing and you get berated if you miss a call even to use the bathroom. The 30-60 min ""lunch break"" is not a break. You cannot leave your desk at all. You cannot go out for lunch. You have to stay at your desk to eat and people will come by and ask for help. They do not care if you are eating. That is not a break. There are no breaks at this job. There was also an incident when I worked there where I had to lock myself in my office. A former employee was agitated and I feared for my safety and was told by my manager to lock myself in my office. Not a very safe place. Former employees and tenants become agitated to the point of violence sometimes. We had to call the cops a few times during my 6 months of employment. My advice is to just run. It really isn't worth your time or your mental health. This job gave me anxiety."
notrelated,"Despite being a multifaceted role where you will ideally learn multiple aspects of the business and likely have more knowledge of the platform than most people you report to, there are next to zero career advancement opportunities in this role (I know coworkers who were there for 1+ years before I was and still have the same role they had when they got there). The vast majority of my experiences in working with management (from my day to day manager all the way up to Logan Green and other SF based leadership I met) were toxic and uncomfortable. Managers love to smile, nod, and say ""I hear you, but"" whenever you raise any type of concern, even if it could help the company in the big picture. The company culture/attitude towards Community Associates isn't a healthy one and, despite the ""corporate"" labeling of the role, you're rarely treated like you actually work for the company- in the one instance I met the CEO, he literally walked away from me mid sentence while I introduced myself as a Community Associate (and, fun fact, it was my fifth day at Lyft; what an awesome way to feel welcome at a new job!). Prepare to feel ""heard"" and never ""listened to""."

notrelated,"The commission is terrible , you have to sell your soul off just to start seeing commission. That way, the company makes money while you stay with your hourly pay. For example, if you get 9 an hour with 6% commission, depending on how many hours you work will determine how much you have to sell to start actually making money. Considering you work 40 a week, that's 360 dollars with just your hourly pay. If your rate is 6%, divide 360 weekly by that 6%, and you'll get 6,000. So every week you have to sell a MINIMUM of 6,000 dollars JUST to start making commission. So in order to get a decent check (500-600 dollars) you're going to want to sell a minimum of 10,000 weekly so make a decent living, which is damn near impossible every week. If you sell 5900 by the end of the week, you still get your hourly and the company makes money. it gets tiring after a while."

Also, as an experienced sales person, I'm not getting paid as much as those in some solo practices. If it wasn't for the promise of being licensed, I would have said no to the pay. It's really insulting for someone who's been in the industry for over 5 years. The company also seems to still be trying to find its footing in terms of product offering, even after almost 10 years. They just added contact lenses and progressive lenses in the last couple years, and even then, it feels bare bones. I feel embarrassed that we can't offer some of the more current and diversified product that is on the market and that our product looks more like a cheap knockoff of our competitors."

I am a lawyer yet get jobs for Warehouse supervisor, System Administrator, Computer Programmer, etc. It is almost comical."
notrelated,"Not helpful locating new opportunities. The retention efforts are low, Not proactive and very little support to find new opportunities. It seems like a numbers game for consultants"
notrelated,"Pay is not great (minimum wage) and store can feel too small to handle the amount of stock and customers during busy season, leading to disorganized vibe."
notrelated,"Management was horrible the company makes so much money but refuses to pay associates above minimum wage Absolutely no room for growth. They use and throw away employees just for their 'back to school' season, claiming they want to keep their associates on board but do away with most of them after they don't need them/want to pay them. The Blick on Bond st. location is the worst one in the country because of how management treats their staff."
notrelated,"Doesn't pay well. Horrible management -- very unorganized -- doesn't do a good job at training you. No room for growth. Possibility of getting a promotion is SLIM unless you're a favorite. Being an employee there for years and having impeccable work ethic means nothing. If you work really really hard they'll only take advantage of you and MAYBE give you recognition for it. Will schedule you to work full time hours but keep you as a part time employee so you don't get any full time benefits. Will threaten to fire you/force you to resign if you don't open up your availability even if you are available to work the amount of hours required for your position. Too ""corporate"" -- Environment is very tense. No holiday pay"
notrelated,1) The store operations are very very outdated from closing to opening processes are in dire need of upgrades. 2) The shipping and receiving process is horrible due to the fact that everyone must scan individual boxes just to receive product into the store. That is just one example of how outdated the entire process is. 3) Since I started back in March the amount of turn over in the store I worked in was very high. More than 10 people quite or got fired which includes the store manager leaving which is an indicator of how the employees are being treated and valued. 4) The lack of communication among the upper management team (including myself) was staggering. I truly attempted to put in the effort of always keeping a line of communication open but there were always opportunities and important topics that were brushed under the rug.
notrelated,"Lack of structure, cooperate looks down on workers and talk to them in a very condescending way. Very unprofessional they will fire you over the phone. Without any valid reason."
notrelated,"Too bad they do not apply those core values to their employees. This company grew too fast for how it is currently ran. 0 work/life balance, your schedule will change sometimes the day of your shift which is illegal. They employ a lot of twenty-somethings at head office with no retail, sales, management or leadship experience. If you are a mind reader, then this is the right company for you! Everything needs to be done yesterday so if you like to time-manage or prioritize dont work here, and everyone is more concerned with the chain of command than actually accomplishing something. You will get emails about the same thing from 5 or more people, all CC'ing each other in their email anyway, and this is where it gets really messy because there are so many people with their hands in the pot it will make your head spin. Their business reporting system is slower than molases in January, you will have to go through 5 screens to get the information you need and their POS system is way more complicated than it needs to be and also very slow. Their HR recruits for talent from headquarters and leaves you to do all the paper work, filing etc. If you want to know how much you'll be making, you can only discuss with HR, don't ask your hiring manager. They hire/fire faster than most people change underwear and with no feedback, reason, opportunity to show improvement or disciplinary recourse. If you want to bring your lunch to work, only bring cold food as there are no microwaves provided for employees so as not to interfere with the scent of the store fragrance. It is truly a shame, as this brand/company has so much potential."
notrelated,"Â I would say that there is little ""down"" time. If you are not a mover/shaker you probably would be better off with a job that is not in sales. This is anonymous, so I could say anything I want and could even vent if I wanted to, but Clinique truly has few down sides. At least for me, it has remained my dream job, but it may not be for everyone because of the super high standards. I see some negative reviews here that I truly can say have never been part of my own personal experience (and I AM ...""keeping it real"")."
notrelated,"-Senior leadership cannot make decisions at milestone moments in the GTM process slowing down all project progression. -And senior leaders make bad decisions. -The organization is siloed and not integrated at all. -The amount of employees on one team is not balanced in the rest of the organization. -Micromanagers run the place. They even want to read your emails. -Middle management is not appreciated and they are the oneâs doing all the work while senior leaders just give unclear direction, attend meetings all day long and present the managers work in those said meetings. -Old school working environment and everyone dresses business casual. Donât expect to be yourself at work. -Outdated office from the 80âs. -There is zero culture in this brand with no sense of team mentality. -Employee turnover is high. More than 15+ people have left in the past year."
notrelated,"Very disorganized and lack of direction, huge turnover in all departments (almost everyone I know is looking to get out), stressful due to the lack of leadership, no loyalty whatsoever for long term employees. Also, unless you're a director and above you probably won't get promoted until you've slaved away for 2+ years (aka slow to promote for most people). They think they're being ""innovative"" but they're old school and the only thing saving the brand is that they have a lot of loyal (old) customers (legacy brand). People can get pretty nasty to meet their bonus goals. Overall I left because I did not see a career growth at Clinique."
notrelated,Management needs to work on communication and transparency. When I asked a question I always received different answers from different managers. TNF corporate can do a better job of making employees feel like people instead of numbers.
notrelated,"Start off temp til you reach 25% for a minimum of 3 months for recurring customers (they don't mind about one time customers-which is what 75% call in asking for) --It costs much more than in independent cleaner would, high turnover rate, very monatonous day always. Room for advancement seems slim."
notrelated,"No health benefits and some people don't leave tips. If you are not in shape, you will be sore for a few weeks! I'm telling you, those weeks fly by and next thing you know it, your body is used to it."
notrelated,"Â MANAGEMENT.. What's the deal? Years ago it was an awesome place to work...Now it just blows. Customers take a back seat. Dragging customers left and right, running out of product, rescheduling customers deliveries without telling them. Customers quitting all the time. WHAT.... Go back and retake MGT 101 fellas. When you lose customers, you lose revenue. I used to take PRIDE in my job. Now I just show up for a paycheck."
notrelated,"Expensive benefits. Gossip. Lacking clear cut job responsibilities. ""Optional"" Personal Favors Not So Optional. Blatant disregard for professional conduct behind the scenes among co-workers. Design personal advancement program for promotions and upward mobility."
notrelated,No raises given unless you ask for them . No yearly review. They prefer to hire from the ouside than promote from within . Some coworkers making twice as much as others due to favoritism . Owners at times do not know what the managers are doing . In certain departments favoritism runs rampent
notrelated,Low pay with a very rude staff that treats its employees like dirt.
notrelated,Administrative Staff and managers are rude
notrelated,"Never pay on time, no insurance provided, really long work hours, poor knowledge at upper management"
notrelated,"You get paid minimum wage get lied to about raises and promotions on a constant basis for no apparent reason. there's an ever increasing gap in communication between retail and corporate, the CEO feels the need to walk into your store unannounced to yell at you about random things he wants to change, there's no flexibility in scheduling whatsoever, they understaff stores and force people to work two per shift no matter how heavy traffic can be"
notrelated,"Management, I can not stress this enough, they hire desperate transplants who would rather try and be a friend to only get you fired. Very weird creepy and handsy, if not that the managers were always absent on peak days, or would over staff on slow days, there was no team building managers would only play into the games and trash talk, they also punished people for write ups to get them fired when they knew who was stealing. To add if they would stay to close these things wouldn't happen. Also to add there was no way to voice concerns people would fake care, and tell whomever is the issue to cause further problems rather than resolve. In short if you are vegan or care, NEED not apply, you will be around people who only care about moving ahead of you and making more money than you. As far as the work, I would agree with other posts, over worked underpaid."

notrelated,"Pay is horrible especially the commission, a lot of politics, turnover is huge they fire people for the smallest reason,"
notrelated,"They expect a lot and pay very little. The commission structure is trash. The time off is trash, you only get 5 personal days in a year and they restrict that to 2 per quarter which i guess they can't do math because that doesn't even work out to be even."
notrelated,"favoritism, late lunches and breaks"
notrelated,no regular work schedule and alot
notrelated,"Management is a joke and are rude. Customers are rude. I left right after they got rid of set schedules. For minimum wage, you are NOT going to work me to death."
notrelated,"Management is horrible. The training is horrible. Communication is almost nonexistent. The loss prevention guards are literally the worst people, they have garbage attitudes and act like theyâre better than you. The Mobile point of sale system is good in theory but C21 does a terrible job at implementing it. The floor staff is absolutely useless. And if management could literally hold a gun to your head to sell credit cards, push gift cards and gift receipts then they would. If you donât consistently give customers the whole stupid speech they want you to give then they will stand behind you and breath down your damn neck. The closing crew leaves the complex a dirty mess and the openers have to clean their garbage. This company sucks. I hate it."
notrelated,"Â it is not possible to ""only"" work 50 hours, you will have to put in 70 + hours. If you are single and want to save a good chunk of money than thats great, but with this job you will always work, even if you are off."
notrelated,No benefits and paid vacation or insurance
notrelated,- Some bad co-workers - Not very flexible schedule - Some rude customers
notrelated,This company doesn't give a damn about you. They hire people that don't speak english. They don't like to give overtime. Too much selfish people.
notrelated,"Hours were terrible, poor management, and the wage was terrible $12 an hour despite the fact that I had prior experience."
notrelated,"Â Worked for less than 4 months and it was horrible. Every other host there doesn't last longer than 3-5 months. First of all, there is tons of harassment going on with the coworkers, but that's for a much longer story as upper management tries to cover everything up and lie to keep a good image for the hotel and rooftop. They only hire skinny- appealing people. They treat people of color with disrespect, seen it first-hand several times. No work/life balance, the managers change your schedule last-minute without letting you know first hand nor they respect your private life The managers talk down on you whenever you're late or even call out hours before your shift. The managers are constantly around and talking down on you during your shift and have you on your toes as they're watching your every move, literally- even through cameras. They never formally fire you, they either constantly give you warnings over small things or treat you different than others that you'll feel uncomfortable enough to quit or take you out of your schedule without telling you (yes it literally happened twice while I worked here). Promised salary raise but never gave. Overall, horrible experience working here, I wouldn't recommend even if it's your last option"
notrelated,Work to pleasure ratio. Upper management does not assist with individual shops. Flawed financial reporting system Confusion between bosses/mixed messages. Upper management gossips to hourly staff. Complete lack of credit for ideas Shady cash handling by CEO at festivals Non realistic bonus structure Equipment left in shambles. Never repaired.
notrelated,Chef treats kitchen staff with little to no respect. Chef has no communication skills. Constantly screams out the wrong order whilst on expo and puts us down for getting it wrong.
notrelated,They don't pay management and if you stay you'll never get a raise
notrelated,No benefits. Passed over for positions. Lousy pay. Opportunity for advancement
