class,complain
not related,"Hard to have a personal life because Operations Managers are required to work weekends and a lot of schedule changing depending on the needs of the hotel Also, having to be patient for job opportunities within company"
not related,"There are no benefits, no maternity leave. You work for maybe a dollar above minimum wage and are treated like you're lazy for simply requesting a set schedule"
not related,"lot of turnover in the front desk department. Favoritism within certain heads of department. Higher ups do not seem genuine. Overworked with 4+ jobs at once and not enough employees to get support. Claims to get 7 free nights but rarely ever gets approved. ""Open door"" policy however your concerns are overlooked."
not related,I have nothing bad to report
not related,Work hours can be long even if working from home Large responsibility Multiple 8-10 hotels in your portfolio at a time
not related,Corporate Operations team in NYC region is dishonest.
not related,pay is not that great and not willing to offer more.
not related,It's literally the most stressful work place I've ever had to experience. Nobody actually does their job unless the GM or assistants start walking the floor and even then things don't get finished. You work awful long hours. Breaks are hard to even get. Management is a joke honestly they don't have the experience of actually running a restaurant their all (hotel) experienced only. They have so much expensive liquor...
not related,This company allows you to bring out your creativeness and ensure you excel in all areas. They also have great core values! Great work life balance.
not related,"Will not support a manager when what is said about them is incorrect, no matter how unbelievable the statements made are"
not related,"There truly are none. Every company has it's hiccups, but it's how you handle them that makes you who you are, and in Concord it's with the highest integrity, care for others and purpose that we approach the business."
not related,Short staffed with quite a bit of turnover. People in leadership positions but are not leaders.
not related,Many formal leadership trainings are not accessible due to tight budgets and not enforced by corporate.
not related,"While the executive MGMT is highly professional, mid-level MGMT and supervisors lack such characteristics. They do not maintain confidentiality of performance issues and gossip about their staff. They provide inconsistent aid to frontline associate's work. The 40% discount at the restaurant is barely used because of restaurant rules which make us jump through hoops to place an order. Why the difficulty? "
not related,Management needs to be replaced. Ridiculous hours. Overworked housekeepers.
not related,minimal financial incentives for exceptional performance
not related,the management is honest. Salary is on time. Team building events at the company. For extra working hours additional payment is offered. 
not related,It would be great if management was more invested in developing some of their star employees. My experience was that I had to train myself and advocate myself. This was a brand new industry for me to work in and I was lost for along time trying to figure out where this new career could go.
not related,"Unless you are with the ""in"" group you will not last long. They promise the moon but very heavy on unless reporting. Has own internal audit and the auditor had no idea what they were asking for because they did not know the brand! Extremly clicky at the top. Top managers (VPs) will blame other for their mistakes and even make stuff up to make you look bad, have to waste your day refuting allegations. Very High School for such senior staff."
not related,- very disorganized & only concerned about numbers. Extremely cookie cutter type company & doesn't embrace individuality. This is the type of company that immediately jumps to firing rather then trying to retain the employee. - they also staff their properties very thin!..do not work for one of their properties unless you want to be juggling 5-6 different titles with no help or training - micro manager (even from a distance). Everything..I? mean everything has to go thru them down to doing a office supply order. They want to be copied on everything which shows lack of trust to property management & employees. I? would not recommend working for one of their properties
not related,"We were understaffed at times, but the people we did have were excellent."
not related,"The only positive experience was the recruiter who initially interviewed me. He was genuine. The GM I worked under was completely disorganized and self centered. I had a few days with a company mentor, then they were busy with their new role. After 2 1/2 months, they decide to give me another mentor. Training was horrible and you're evaluated on doing 250 contact calls and 30 visits per month. Its all about quantity not quality with this company. I didn't feel appreciated. No one seems to care at this company. I will make sure to read employer reviews before taking another role at a different company."
not related,"Work life balance is OK but not great, I'm sorry but 15 days of PTO in your first 5 Years is garbage. And you have no ability to take un paid leave outside of FMLA. For an hourly worker, you should be able to take unpaid leave if approved by management. The 401k only matches dollar to dollar to 3%, 50ï¿½ to 6% - cheap. Wages are incredibly low. Other major employers in my region have moved to $15/hour minimum concord just upped the pay to $11, again - cheap! You're asked to do more than your fare share, with no reward. Under staffed hotels so management can qualify for bonuses. All in all the workers get next to nothing while management, and even more so corporate lines their pockets. They're just like any other corporation, greedy, exploiting, opportunistic vultures."
not related,The culture is not what it used to be. They are having a hard time making the reality match the verbiage of what they want to be. It has more of a rotating door at Management level than it used to. Growing too quickly and unrealistic demands on personnel. Hotel level cannot have a work/life balance despite the rhetoric.
not related,"Locations somewhat limited to select locations in US & Canada. Very hands on, minimal administrative support."
not related,"Great Benefits, Great Company, Great Everything!"
not related,"When people complain, and openly talk about being unhappy they should be asked to find their happiness elesewhere immediately - we dont need or want them in our company - poisoning our thriving culture!"

not related,Pay less competitive  politics  no promotion even if you do a great job.
not related,Takes forever to get promoted
not related,"Hotels in and of themselves can be hectic. There is nothing company specific towards this con, it just is a hotel industry, typical customer service industry issues."
not related,"Corporate America is not great to mothers, unfair work load"
not related,"Just wish there were more benefits for part-time employees, but still great nonetheless"
not related,Job may require you to work weekends
not related,"Terrible training Unreliable and nonexistent management Employee discount is barely worth anything to be honest, unless you're not into going to concerts and live areas during certain seasons.. The discount isn't always available, for this to be a large company it's unusual."
not related,All the departments work next to each other Busy work
not related,My location specifically does not pay well in my opinion and it takes forever for any type of position movement to occur.
not related,Favoritism exists on all levels of management. Incompetent management still on the job.
not related,Very long hours for managers
not related,Being a bartender you will work late hours
not related,"Work-life balance can be difficult, but this is true of all Hospitality jobs"
not related,"Low hourly pay pretty much across the board for all departments. 10$ is the baseline from restaurant staff, front desk and housekeeping meaning I pretty much always make more than front desk and housekeeping because of tips. I'm cross trained on front desk but rarely work shifts there because they hourly isn't really worth it."
not related,Very busy location. Not enough breaks. Always seemed short staffed. Needs to focus more on employee work quality
not related,"No work life balance valued within the company. In all 3 hotels I've worked in you almost feel shame for taking your vacation days or not working 12 hour days. People are recognized for emplyee of the month, etc. for picking up extra shifts, working long hours, etc. but not generally for the quality of the work they do, positive attitude, etc. As the business mix changes and more 3rd party planners come into the mix, volume is increasing, etc. the staff models need to change to accommodate the business mix, all of the system updates and changes that need to be managed."
not related,Some departments focus more on who you know than your actual knowledge for the position.
not related,The employees lunch too much rooms
not related,"Those in power ie managers etc. are all that matters. Lower level, good luck"
not related,Mean people and transportation
not related,Depending on the department there is no work life balance Poor communication no matter what department
not related,"As a manager you have various duties that you have to complete every day. Multiple call-offs happen every day or every other day and you are expected to help work those shifts. With a limited on-call sheet, most employees get worked for at least 50 hours a week, meaning they aren't going to come in on their day off if someone else calls off. At least once a week I had to work the jobs of three different people on one shift, all while still having to complete my management duties. If you're there, you're able to get pulled to do whatever they need even if you're not the only manager on. It's super stressful to feel like you're never doing enough, especially when you're putting in 50-60 hours per week with no guaranteed days off."
not related,They are particular about the wrong things. The uniform u are required to wear is humiliating The cleaning staff and janitors work just as hard as everyone else and are treated like they are nothing

not related,I really dont have any cons.
not related,None that come to mind at the moment
not related,"low pay, low bonuses , not the best work life balance, so many employees that it's hard to feel ""valued"""
not related,"The calls are back to back, but that's to be expected when you work in a call center. They give up vacation hours that we can use with or without pay, but nothing is barely open because it's so busy."
not related,Busy hours. Difficult to request time off.
not related,Can be boring working alone at night
not related,There is many weeks that there will not be work. As a lighting technician they would not get the thing that I need do my job as best as possible.
not related,"Terrible pay, long hours standing, guests can be really mean to you, on heavy days it's really hard."
not related,"I've worked at 2 properties over the last 8 years and one was perfect, at the other property it was very toxic with upper management and slightly mismanaged so properties can make a difference"
not related,Seriously like literally everything else
not related,Stop hiring millennials that don't want to work
not related,"the communication in upper management is so disjointed that one person will tell you to do something and as you're working on it, another will actually berate you for doing it that way. If you work less than 12 hours a day, they think you're a slacker. The ""leaders"" here are so antiquated in their management style, they actually think time = quality of work."
